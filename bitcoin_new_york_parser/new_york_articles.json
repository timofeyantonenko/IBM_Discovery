Yet that represented a small fraction of those affected, and the company said it still remained unlikely that people would regain control of their computers if they paid the online fee.\nAdvertisement\nThe tally of ransom payments may rise ahead of Friday\u2019s deadline, but cybersecurity experts say the current numbers \u2014 both total ransom money paid and machines decrypted \u2014 are far short of early estimates forecasting that the digital attack may eventually cost victims hundreds of millions of dollars in combined ransom fees.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI predict this may be an epic failure,\u201d said Kim Peretti, a former senior litigator in the Department of Justice\u2019s computer crime and intellectual property division who now is co-chairwoman of the cybersecurity preparedness and response team at Alston & Bird, an international law firm. \u201cBecause of the publicity of this attack and the public\u2019s awareness of people potentially not getting their files back, the figures aren\u2019t as high as people had first thought.\u201d\nFor victims of such attacks, the potential loss of personal or business files can be traumatic. In typical ransomware cases, including the most recent hack, assailants send an encrypted email to potential targets. The message includes a malware attachment that takes over their machines if opened. The attackers then demand payment before returning control of the computers, often through money paid into bitcoin or other largely untraceable online currencies.\nThe latest ransomware strike, experts said, was particularly virulent because it was based on malicious software stolen from the National Security Agency. Law enforcement agencies from the United States, Britain and elsewhere have been tracking the potential culprits, with suspicions now focusing on hackers in North Korea.\nAdvertisement\nFor Randy Meyers, a technology consultant for a rural hospital in western Texas, the recent ransomware attack has brought back bitter memories.\nAdvertisement\nLast month, Mr. Meyers discovered that a similar virus had taken over critical computers at a 25-bed medical facility in Fisher County, roughly a three-hour drive from Fort Worth. The virus locked physicians and other medical staff out of patient records, and his repeated pleas by email to the attackers to unlock the vital machines went unanswered.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Still, he said, the attack had crippled the hospital for four days, with doctors and nurses resorting to pen and paper.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like going home and finding out you\u2019ve been broken into,\u201d said Mr. Meyers, who said he had never before experienced such an attack in more than 20 years as a technology consultant. \u201cYou never want to have to pay the ransom. It gives them a reason to do it again and again.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nFor some organizations, particularly government agencies, paying to decrypt locked-out computers is not even an option. In many countries, including across Europe and Asia, the payment of any form of ransom is forbidden by laws often written to counter terrorist attacks in the offline world. That means organizations like Britain\u2019s National Health Service, among the worst affected in the recent ransomware attacks, are left with few options to retrieve data that can have life-or-death implications.\nIn the United States, there is no nationwide policy outlawing such ransomware payments. But experts still warn against handing over money because it may lead to far more significant costs down the road.\nAdvertisement\nExclusion and cooperation clauses in many cyberinsurance policies expressly prohibit businesses from paying such digital ransoms without pre-approval. If a victim hands over the money anyway, insurers may cancel a business\u2019s coverage and leave clients paying out of pocket \u2014 including covering the cost of disruptions to their businesses, remediation expenses and customer notifications.\n\u201cIn general, the advice is not to pay,\u201d said Kevin Kalinich, a global cyber-risk expert at Aon, the insurance broker. \u201cThe perpetrators may not release your data, or you\u2019ll be considered a target for future attacks.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nJorge Reza, a sales manager for a construction business in Laredo, Tex., was forced to take that gamble when the company he works for was hit with a ransomware attack last year.\nAdvertisement\nHours after one of his colleagues was locked out of the business\u2019s main computer, which held company invoices, payroll data and other sensitive information, Mr. Reza, 34, found himself online, researching how to open a bitcoin account and other tips for paying the digital ransom.\nDespite fears the assailants would not unlock the computer, Mr. Reza uploaded money through Western Union, found someone who would sell him $1,200 worth of bitcoin and waited for notification that the machine had been returned to his control. The process, Mr. Reza said, was both stressful and uncertain, as he could not be sure the attackers would follow through on their promises. Luckily, less than 12 hours after the initial attack, he was able to decrypt his files.\n\u201cThey were digital terrorists, but at least they were honest,\u201d Mr. Reza said. \u201cThey were holding our data hostage.

In the United States, a company called Coinbase will link to your bank account or credit card and then sell you the coins for American dollars. Opening an account with Coinbase is similar to opening a traditional bank or stock brokerage account, with lots of verification of your identity needed.\nAdvertisement\nFor people who do not want to reveal their identities, there are services like LocalBitcoins that will connect local people who want to buy and sell Bitcoin for cash, generally without any verification of identity required.\nAdvertisement\nTo start accepting Bitcoin is even easier.

Law enforcement or financial authorities can sometimes use the blockchain to track transactions among criminals. But as long as the criminals do not associate a real-world identity with their Bitcoin address, they are generally safe. Complicating matters further, there are increasingly sophisticated Bitcoin laundering services, known as tumblers, which mix large quantities of transactions together in order to make it harder for the authorities to track the transactions.\nWhere it can get more difficult for hackers is when they want to convert the Bitcoin they have received into a traditional national currency. Most companies that convert Bitcoin to dollars in the United States require that their customers provide identification. If a criminal registered with a company like that, it would be relatively easy for the police to track them down.\nBut there are many Bitcoin exchanges outside the United States that do not require customers to register with a real-world identity. LocalBitcoins also makes it easy to find someone in any city around the world who will meet you in person and pay cash for Bitcoin without requiring any identification \u2014 a sort of Craigslist for Bitcoin exchanges. It is also getting easier to buy goods online using Bitcoin, without ever converting the digital currency into dollars or euros.\nAdvertisement\nThe price of Bitcoin has been rising, and recently hit a high above $2,000. Like gold, the price of Bitcoin has always been driven by the scarcity of the digital tokens. When Bitcoin was created in 2009, it was determined that only 21 million coins would ever be created.\nAdvertisement\nTechnology investors have purchased coins and pushed up the price out of a belief that the tokens and the system will be a sort of global digital currency and financial network for the future.\nWhile real-world transactions have been slow to take off, Bitcoin has continued to be popular for black market uses like ransomware and online drug markets like the Silk Road and its successors.\nAdvertisement\nThe corporate world has also taken interest in the technology that enables Bitcoin, especially its decentralized financial network and the blockchain, the global ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Many banks are making big bets that real-world financial transactions will one day be run on networks similar to Bitcoin, which can operate more quickly, efficiently and securely than traditional financial networks.\nThere are now many competitors to Bitcoin, like Ethereum, and their value has also been pushed up by growing interest in the Bitcoin technology. But Bitcoin has remained the largest so-called cryptocurrency and is generally the one that people use to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies.\n", "name": "What Is Bitcoin?

Europol said its team of cybersecurity specialists \u2014 made up of agents from countries like Germany, Britain and the United States \u2014 was investigating the attack.\nEurope and Asia were the regions most affected by the crime, with hospitals, car plants and even the Russian Ministry of Interior falling prey to the malware, which takes over a computer, locks down the machine and releases it only when the owner has paid a ransom.\nAdvertisement\nHours after the attack was first reported in Britain, where the computer systems of the National Health Service were crippled, law enforcement agencies across Europe, Asia and the United States began looking for clues that could trace the assault to specific people or organizations.\nAdvertisement\nAs with a physical crime scene, the first step with any cyberinvestigation is to make sure the criminal is no longer hiding out, about to pounce again.\n\u201cBefore we get into who did it, we try to figure out if the bad guys still have access,\u201d said Theresa Payton, a former chief information officer of the White House and founder of Fortalice, a cybersecurity firm. \u201cAre they still hiding?

Patricia Lewis, the international security research director at Chatham House in London, likened the text of the email to a physical letter and its metadata to the envelope it arrives in.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAn envelope has lots of information on it: the stamp with the time and place it was sent from, the handwriting or printer type, a sender\u2019s address, maybe a fingerprint or DNA from saliva on the seal,\u201d Ms. Lewis said.\nAdvertisement\nCriminals are aware their emails contain revealing clues, and they try to cover their tracks. \u201cPeople use cloakers, which hide your identity, making you look as if you are someone and somewhere else,\u201d she said.\nLike tracing the license plates of a stolen car back to the wrong person, this can lead investigators astray. \u201cBut a good detective can track them,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cThey always leave digital bread crumbs that can be followed.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nInvestigators will check whether the email address the malware came from is linked to social media accounts, past cybercrimes or other locations on the web. They will study the domain name it is linked to. And they will look for patterns to try to connect one crime to others.\nAdvertisement\nSuccess often depends on whether law enforcement can tie small digital details, including potential mistakes or a certain style in the programming code, back to the criminals. The location of where some of the ransom money is withdrawn can also help connect the dots.\nSometimes the patterns that lead investigators to their target can be surprising. One state-sponsored hack was traced to Russia because detectives noticed those responsible were online only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Moscow time, Ms. Lewis recalled. In another case, hackers were observing Chinese holidays.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Sony was hacked, officials linked the malware that was used to one that had been used before in North Korea. \u201cThat was a big clue,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cBut of course it could have been deliberately planted.\u201d\nIn the recent hack of the political campaign of the new  president of France, Emmanuel Macron, for instance, security experts were able to link the registration of certain website domains used in the attack to Russian hackers.\nInvestigators in the latest attack are looking for clues in the ransom notes written in more than 20 languages. Some suggested that the assailants might have connections to China because the Mandarin version of the text was better written than its English equivalent.\nAdvertisement\nOnce equipped with enough identifying data to start narrowing down suspects, investigators will go undercover to listen to the chatter on technology boards where cybercriminals are known to spend time. \u201cIt\u2019s like using an undercover operative purporting to be part of a criminal gang, except it\u2019s online,\u201d Mr. Inkster said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHalf the dark web are cyberagents these days,\u201d Ms. Lewis joked. \u201cThey\u2019re tripping over each other.\u201d\nOne of the most challenging new developments for investigators is the use of Bitcoin, a digital currency with little oversight.\nAdvertisement\nIn the latest attack, the criminals demanded ransoms ranging from $300 to $600, to be paid in Bitcoin.\nBitcoin accounts, or wallets, are extremely difficult to trace. While law enforcement agencies have cracked cases by tracking Bitcoin transactions, the process is arduous.\nAdvertisement\n", "name": "How to Catch Hackers?

For years, there have been stories of individuals or companies horrified that they have been locked out of their computers and that the only way back in is to pay a ransom to someone, somewhere who has managed to take control.\nAdvertisement\nBut computer criminals are discovering that ransomware is the most effective way to make money in the shortest amount of time. The advent of new tools that wrap victims\u2019 data with tough encryption technology, hard-to-trace digital currency like Bitcoin, and even online sites that offer to do the data ransoming in return for a piece of the action, have made this method of cybertheft much easier.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to have any skills to do this anymore,\u201d said Jason Rebholz, a senior director at the Crypsis Group who has helped dozens of victims of ransomware.\nRansomware has allowed people who are not computer experts to become computer thieves. It used to be that hackers had to be a little creative and skilled to get money out of people. There were fake antivirus scams that promised to clean up your computer \u2014 for a fee.\nAdvertisement\nSometimes they resorted to so-called Trojan horse programs that lay in wait on e-commerce or banking sites, ready to get your credit card numbers. And there was old-fashioned hacking, grabbing all sorts of personal credentials that could be sold on the so-called dark web.\nAdvertisement\nFour years ago, investigators were pursuing roughly 16 variants of ransomware that were predominantly being used on victims in Eastern Europe. Now there are dozens of types of ransomware, and they are supported by an entire underground industry. And catching and convicting the people responsible is difficult.\nAdvertisement\nFriday\u2019s attacks were a powerful escalation of earlier, much smaller episodes. Hackers exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft servers that was first discovered by the National Security Agency and then leaked online by a group of unknown hackers last month. It allowed the ransomware to spread from server to server, encrypting as many files as it could, and holding more than 70,000 organizations victim in the process.\nAs of Saturday afternoon, several Bitcoin accounts associated with the ransomware had received the equivalent of $33,000, according to Elliptic, a firm that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies. And the number could grow.\nThe attack should not have been a shock. As data has become our lifeline, cybercriminals have elevated their game and their demands. Just five years ago, attackers in Eastern Europe were locking up victims\u2019 computers and demanding ransoms of $100 to $400 to unlock them.\nAdvertisement\nBack then, the idea of paying a criminal on the internet was still foreign, and most important, technicians and security experts could find ways to unlock computers without caving on the ransom. In 2012, security experts estimated that  less than 3 percent of victims paid.\nAdvertisement\nThese days, it\u2019s a 50-50 split between those who pay the ransom and those who refuse, either because they have adequate backups, are philosophically opposed or simply cannot afford to pay.\nRansoms now range from as little as one Bitcoin, which equates to roughly $1,700, to as many as 30 Bitcoin, nearly $51,000, with the median ransom equating to four Bitcoin, or nearly $7,000, according to researchers at the Crypsis Group.\nBitcoin has given cybercriminals an easy and anonymous way to get their profits, and it is much harder to track than credit cards or wire transfers.\nAdvertisement\nThere is even now a concept of \u201cransomware as a service\u201d \u2014 a play on the Silicon Valley jargon \u201csoftware as a service,\u201d which describes the delivery of software over the internet.\nAdvertisement\nNow anyone can visit a web page, generate a ransomware file with the click of a mouse, encrypt someone\u2019s systems and demand a ransom to restore access to the files. If the victim pays, the ransomware provider takes a cut of the payment.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

There are even live chat options. And while some amateur ransomware attackers may not restore victims\u2019 data once the ransom is paid, the more professional outfits worry that if they do not decrypt a victim\u2019s data, their reputation and \u201cbusiness\u201d may suffer as a result, Mr. Rebholz said.\nThe most notorious of these attackers, a group called SamSam after its type of ransomware, is known for demanding the highest ransoms, 25 to 30 Bitcoin. But they reliably decrypt a victim\u2019s data after being paid.\nAdvertisement\nMost small- to medium-size businesses pay the ransoms because they do not have backups of their data and feel they have no other option, Mr. Rebholz said. \u201cThat data is the bloodline of their business in many cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can either go out of business or pay the ransom.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nCybercriminals have also found a soft target in universities, which usually have more open systems that allow for the free flow of information.\nMore recently, they have found a niche in health care, where ransomware attacks take on a new level of urgency as doctors and emergency rooms in Britain discovered on Friday when hackers blocked their access to patient records, and patients had to be turned away.\nAdvertisement\nImperial College Healthcare in London, for example, was hit with ransomware 19 times over 12 months, according to freedom-of-information requests submitted by SentinelOne, a security firm.\nAdvertisement\nIn the United States, the number of reported ransomware attacks rose fourfold between 2015 and 2016, as did the ransom payments to hackers, to $1 billion, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nLast year hospitals in California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and Texas were hit with ransomware. And in February, a Los Angeles hospital paid $17,000 to hackers to regain access to its computers.\nAdvertisement\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Krishna Chinthapalli published an article in the British Medical Journal warning that such an attack was imminent. Dr. Chinthapalli cited a report that one out of every three British National Health Service trusts, the health care providers that serve specific geographic regions or offer specialized mental health or ambulance services, were hit by ransomware last year.\n\u201cIn the past three months, health care providers have been preparing themselves for these attacks, either with Bitcoin at the ready or with professional incident responders,\u201d said Chris Camacho, the chief strategy officer at Flashpoint, a New York company that tracked Friday\u2019s attacks.\nNearly half of ransomware attacks begin by persuading an employee to click on an email. Sometimes the methods used by cybercriminals are more complex. A \u201cwatering hole attack,\u201d for example, infects a website with ransomware code. When users visit the site, that code is downloaded onto their machine.\nAdvertisement\nThe other half, Mr. Rebholz and others said, target victims with \u201cbrute force\u201d methods: Hackers scan an organization for software vulnerabilities, weak passwords or other unlocked digital doors. After that, ransomware attackers try to encrypt as many files as possible. The SamSam group is known to move from file to file, manually encrypting hundreds of systems, so it can demand the highest in Bitcoin ransoms, according to the Crypsis Group, Symantec and others.\nAdvertisement\nIt seems no one is immune. In January, a hacker held hostage a small cancer charity in Indiana, wiping the organization\u2019s main and backup servers and demanding 50 Bitcoin \u2014 more than $87,000 \u2014 in return for restoring their data. They did not pay.\n", "name": "With New Digital Tools, Even Nonexperts Can Wage Cyberattacks"}, {"text": "The lack of such regulation, the commission said, raised \u201cconcerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this market.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe price of Bitcoin has climbed sharply in recent weeks in anticipation of the commission approving the Winklevoss brothers\u2019 fund, with the price of a single Bitcoin surging to a record high above $1,300.\nBitcoin aficionados had hoped that an exchange-traded fund would help bring the virtual currency into the mainstream by making it available to retail investors through brokerage firms like Charles Schwab and eTrade.\nSeveral other companies have also applied to operate Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, and the S.E.C. could reach a different decision on those proposed funds.

Doubters have said that it is, at best, a slightly more reliable way to track data, and at worst, a much less efficient method of keeping data than current ones that rely on central gatekeepers.\nAdvertisement\nBut blockchain champions like to compare it to the significance of the internet, which provided a universal computing language for communicating seamlessly among networks. The blockchain, they say, could provide that universal language for valuable data and information.\nA few months after Mr. Krishna\u2019s aha moment, his team presented the idea at an annual gathering where IBM\u2019s top executives consider new technologies that could be major opportunities \u2014 or threats \u2014 to IBM\u2019s business. Blockchain was the first subject of discussion, and the first that Virginia Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive, gave the green light to.\nAdvertisement\nShe turned to Mr. Krishna, the research chief, and said, \u201cYou run with this,\u201d he recalled. She asked for a working version within two months.\nAdvertisement\nHer hurry-up response was a reflection, in part, of IBM\u2019s eagerness to find new businesses to make up for the erosion of its traditional hardware, software and services offerings. The company has made progress with new products like data-analysis software and its Watson artificial intelligence software.\nBut growth in new businesses has not yet offset declines in traditional businesses. In January, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarterly drop in revenue, though some of that sales retreat was because of profit-draining operations the company sold off, like semiconductor manufacturing and industry-standard server computers.\nAdvertisement\nIBM has already suffered from being late to one of the biggest trends in technology today, cloud computing, where it moved slowly at first and watched the early market leadership go to Amazon and Microsoft. Today, Mr. Krishna said, \u201cThe first-mover advantage is even more important than it used to be.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAfter getting Ms. Rometty\u2019s push on the blockchain, the IBM team\u2019s first move was to make its software \u201copen source,\u201d meaning that it would be free and available for anyone to review and tinker with. IBM\u2019s bet was that this would establish its technology as a de facto standard, and that it could make money by selling software and services that would sit on top of the technology.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Like Walmart, Maersk had already been looking for years for a better way to trace the goods it ships around the globe.\nFor Maersk, the problem was not tracking the familiar rectangular shipping containers that sail the world aboard its cargo ships \u2014 instead, it was the mountains of paperwork that go with each container. Maersk had found that a single container could require stamps and approvals from as many as 30 people, including customs, tax officials and health authorities.\nAdvertisement\nWhile the containers themselves can be loaded on a ship in a matter of minutes, a container can be held up in port for days because a piece of paper goes missing, while the goods inside spoil. The cost of moving and keeping track of all this paperwork often equals the cost of physically moving the container around the world.\nWhat\u2019s more, the system is rife with fraud. The valuable bill of lading is often tampered with or copied to let criminals siphon off goods or circulate counterfeit products, leading to billions of dollars in maritime fraud each year.\nMaersk and IBM began working on a version of its software that would be open to everyone involved with every container. When customs authorities signed off on a document, they could immediately upload a copy of it, with a digital signature, so that everyone else involved \u2014 including Maersk and government authorities \u2014 could see that it was complete. If there were disputes later, everyone could go back to the record and be confident that no one had altered it in the meantime. The cryptography involved would make it hard for the virtual signatures to be forged.\nAdvertisement\nThe first test of the system happened last summer and tracked all of the paperwork related to a container of flowers moving from the Port of Mombasa in Kenya to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It went well enough that Maersk and IBM followed up by tracking containers with pineapples from Colombia, and mandarin oranges from California.\nAdvertisement\nThe difficulty of making this work in the real world is that everyone at every step along the way needs to be involved, otherwise it\u2019s unlikely to induce any more confidence than the old system.\n\u201cYou need to have something in it for all stakeholders, in order to get the whole chain going,\u201d said Jakob Stausholm, the chief financial and technology officer at Maersk, who is leading the project. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficult part.\u201d\nIBM and Maersk have recently been seeking cooperation from customs authorities, freight forwarders and the producers that fill the containers. Just last month, Maersk and IBM began running their first trials with these partners involved, on shipping routes between Rotterdam and Newark.\nAdvertisement\nNot everyone has been so willing to buy in to the IBM approach.\nMany technologists who got excited about Bitcoin have said that the newer, corporate-designed blockchains \u2014 like the one being built by IBM \u2014 are missing one of the main elements of Bitcoin\u2019s success, namely the extremely decentralized structure. Anyone in the world can join Bitcoin and, in effect, study its ledgers. But only a limited set of participants can gain access to ones like IBM\u2019s.\nAdvertisement\nThat could make them more vulnerable to attack from, say, a hacker who targets a few of the participants. Even though the IBM technology for tracking shipments is more decentralized than previous methods, \u201cit still concentrates power in a handful of entities,\u201d said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell who studies distributed systems.\nThe companies working with IBM have been less worried about these security issues. Almost all of them demanded that the system not be open like Bitcoin. While they are giving up some security benefits, the private blockchains can move faster than Bitcoin, which has been plagued by delays.\nIBM has faced questions from companies worried that the tech giant has too much control over the system it is building and could make them dependent on IBM software for years to come.\nAdvertisement\nIBM tried to fend off this line of attack when it made its software open source in 2015. The foundation that is now in charge of the computer code, the Hyperledger Foundation, has attracted many other companies that are now working on the project alongside IBM. Just in the past week, the Bank of England, Kaiser Permanente and nine other new members joined.\nAdvertisement\nBut the director of the Hyperledger Foundation, Brian Behlendorf, acknowledged that IBM is still the single largest contributor to the project. As a result, it has been an uphill battle to convince others that it is not simply an IBM project.\n\u201cThey have such a head start that it can leave the impression that Hyperledger is an IBM product,\u201d Mr. Behlendorf said. \u201cWe are trying to tell a story about the other companies building on top of Hyperledger. That is emerging. It will take some time.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMicrosoft has fended off this sort of problem by focusing most of its efforts on a blockchain that it had nothing to do with building, the blockchain behind the virtual currency known as Ethereum. This has already helped Microsoft move in on some clients that IBM is also pursuing. Bank of America, for instance, is building a system with Microsoft that will track the flows of money around trade deals.\nBut IBM has taken an early lead. Its list of collaborators includes the likes of the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of Tokyo, and lots of companies outside the financial world like Maersk and Walmart. \u201cThis is the most well-thought-out project in the space,\u201d said Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor.\nNow all IBM has to do is get the systems out into the real world and show that they work.\n", "name": "Blockchain: A Better Way to Track Pork Chops, Bonds, Bad Peanut Butter?"}, {"text": "The technology is viewed as being harder to corrupt or hack because of its reliance on many people rather than a single authority.\nAdvertisement\nMany big corporations have been looking for ways to use blockchain technology to keep track of information created by unrelated companies, like stock and bond trading transactions.\nIBM has made a particularly big push into the blockchain business, and it has been leading a separate collaborative project, known as the Hyperledger Foundation.\nThe new Ethereum alliance has been described by some of its backers as a way to ensure that the IBM-led blockchain effort is not the only option for businesses looking to use the technology. Other companies like R3 and Chain have also been developing alternative blockchains.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe are pretty equally spending our time across the different chains,\u201d said Alex Batlin, the global head of blockchain at Bank of New York Mellon, which is joining the Ethereum alliance.\nEthereum was introduced in 2013 by a developer named Vitalik Buterin, then 19, who had previously worked on Bitcoin. Since its official release in 2015, the Ethereum network has been the target of hackers and theft.\nAdvertisement\nYet it has also won a large following among programmers who view it as a new and sophisticated way for groups of people and companies to initiate and track transactions and contracts of all sorts.\nThat has led some companies to bet that Ethereum will win the race to become the standard blockchain for future business operations.\n\u201cIn every industry that we come across, Ethereum is usually the first platform that people go to,\u201d said Marley Gray, the principal blockchain architect at Microsoft.\nAdvertisement\nThe creation of the Ethereum alliance shows a continuing commitment among big companies to making the technology work, in large part because it promises to create much more streamlined databases that require less back-office maintenance.\nAdvertisement\nAccenture released a report last month arguing that blockchain technology could save the 10 largest banks $8 billion to $12 billion a year in infrastructure costs \u2014 or 30 percent of their total costs in that area. Accenture is one of 11 companies on the governing board of the Ethereum alliance.\nThe current Ethereum network has an internal virtual currency known as Ether, the value of which has risen and fallen over the last two years. On Monday, a single Ether was worth around $15, and all the outstanding Ether were worth around $1.3 billion.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

It also allows people to write what are known as smart contracts into the Ethereum blockchain. Two companies could, for instance, create a contract that would automatically send money to one of them if a particular news authority reported that the Chicago Cubs won the World Series or that \u201cLa La Land\u201d won the Oscar for best picture. (As the latter example shows, what would happen if the authority was wrong is a more difficult question.)\nAdvertisement\nBecause of its capacity for smart contracts \u2014 and other complicated computing capacities \u2014 Ethereum is viewed as more agile and adaptable than Bitcoin.\nAs with Bitcoin, however, anyone can join the Ethereum network and see all the activity on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe companies working on the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance want to create a private version of Ethereum that can be rolled out for specific purposes and be open only to certified participants. Banks could create one blockchain for themselves, and shipping companies could create another for their own purposes.\nAdvertisement\nThe purpose of the alliance is to create a standard, open-source version of Ethereum that can provide a foundation for any specific use case.\nAdvertisement\nThe private systems are not likely to require an Ether virtual currency, although the companies are hoping to create modules that will allow users to put in and take out individual elements of Ethereum as they choose.\nAdvertisement\nMany companies have already been working to create their own versions of Ethereum for specific purposes.\nJPMorgan, for instance, has created a version of Ethereum known as Quorum that the bank has been using in tests to move money between JPMorgan branches in different countries. Quorum will become a part of the new version of Ethereum being developed by the alliance.\nAdvertisement\nSome of the companies working in the new alliance hope that the private Ethereum blockchains will, at some point, be able to connect to the public Ethereum blockchain, creating a standard for information storage and movement around the world.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cEven if you create private networks, if you can anchor them to public networks, you get an extremely strong set of links together,\u201d Mr. Batlin, of BNY Mellon, said.\nThe work on Ethereum has continued despite an attack on an Ethereum project last year in which a hacker gained control of more than $50 million worth of Ether.\nAdvertisement\n", "name": "Business Giants to Announce Creation of a Computing System Based on Ethereum"}, {"text": "With the 111-year-old hotel brimming with eager skiers, hikers and vacationers, some having paid about $530 for a suite with a panoramic view and sauna, Mr. Brandstaetter said he decided to cave in.\nAdvertisement\nGuests had already complained that their electronic room keys were not working, and receptionists\u2019 efforts to create new ones had proved futile.

As a result, however, hackers waged dozens of attacks a day to make them financially viable.\nHe nevertheless counseled victims not to pay, arguing that that would only further encourage more attacks and that the funds used to pay the ransom would bankroll nefarious activity, including possibly terrorism. Hotels, he warned, should also guard against copycat crimes by reinforcing their digital security.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the United States Justice Department, ransomware attacks quadrupled in 2016 to an average of 4,000 a day. The F.B.I. said the costs to victims of such attacks rose to $209 million in the first three months of 2016, compared with $24 million throughout 2015.\nAdvertisement\nIt is a sign of the crime\u2019s sinister proliferation that it has also entered popular culture.\nIn an episode of the legal drama \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d a Russian hacker attacked a law firm in the middle of a prominent case, encrypting its files and demanding a $50,000 ransom. The hacker eventually relented after the firm turned the tables by infecting the extortionist\u2019s computer with propaganda criticizing Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin.\nIn the real world, however, many have been forced to pay up.\nLast year, hospitals in California and Kentucky were targeted in ransomware attacks. In one case, a Los Angeles hospital paid more than $17,000 to hackers to restore its computer network, and all of its digital medical files.

Credit default swaps, which played a major role in the 2008 financial crisis, are essentially bets on the success of bonds.\nThe D.T.C.C. oversaw about $11 trillion in credit default swaps trading last year, or 80 percent of all trades in the global market. Banks rely on the Trade Information Warehouse to determine when payments are due and what size they will be.\nBecause the database will be edited in group fashion, the hope is that it will provide a more streamlined and reliable source of information.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Bodson said that if the database was successful, the D.T.C.C. could use the technology to move money rather than just record information.\nAdvertisement\nOver the last few years, most banks have announced efforts to explore the potential utility of blockchain technology.

Unlike an investigation of a particular individual who can challenge a summons, the I.R.S. goes into court unopposed and the judge considers only the application and any information provided to support the request, known as an ex parte proceeding.\nIn 2014, the I.R.S. issued a notice that virtual currencies were property, which means that every transaction may result in a capital gain or loss, depending on the value at the time of each trade.

In 2015, a Miami federal district judge issued a summons to Bank of America and Citibank for almost nine years of records from correspondent accounts they maintained on behalf of a bank in Belize that was used to shield assets.\nAdvertisement\nUnfortunately, there is little Coinbase can do to resist this type of demand for information once it is approved by the court. It could refuse to provide the information and then appeal an order requiring it to comply with the summons, but the anonymity cherished by many Bitcoin users is unlikely to get much traction when there is evidence of potential tax evasion. Failing to provide the information could also result in Coinbase being found in contempt of court, which can result in substantial fines until it chooses to comply.\nThe I.R.S. inquiry shows how Coinbase is now important enough to draw the same kind of scrutiny as more established banks.

The agency\u2019s guidance said that people should treat their virtual currency as property, rather than currency, for tax purposes. If a person buys a Bitcoin for $200, for example, then sells it later when its value has risen to $400, the $200 in gains are supposed to be recorded to the tax authorities.\nAdvertisement\nOmri Marian, a professor of tax law at the University of California, Irvine, said that most Bitcoin users were probably not aware that they were supposed to record their losses and gains as taxable events every time they bought anything with their Bitcoins.\n\u201cIt may be the case that many people were not aware that what they were doing is taxable,\u201d Mr. Marian said on Friday. \u201cAre those the people the I.R.S. is looking for?\u201d\nAdvertisement\n", "name": "Bitcoin Users Who Evade Taxes Are Sought by the I.R.S."}, {"text": "While Bitcoin was initially described as an anonymous currency, its transactions are recorded on a public ledger that can be tracked and traced by law enforcement.

Mr. Wilcox is hosting an open virtual meeting later this month with law enforcement officials from across the country to explain the project.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Wilcox and the programmers who created Zcash say that they developed the currency not to facilitate illegal activity but to provide a degree of privacy for people who do not want their financial transactions visible to the world.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe basic story is that we have been gradually losing our privacy in a whole bunch of ways that people don\u2019t appreciate,\u201d said Matthew Green, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins who began developing Zcash with some of his graduate students in 2013. \u201cThis brings back a little bit of that privacy that computers have taken away from us. This technology gives us a defense against something that until now we have been defenseless against.\u201d\nMr. Wilcox said that existing virtual currencies have been unattractive to businesses because their transaction details are exposed to competitors, creating a business need for a more private virtual currency.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAll of the conversations I\u2019ve had with businesses, banks, regulators and law enforcement have been about the need for data security for commercial applications,\u201d he said.\nZcash is modeled closely on Bitcoin. The currency will be released slowly to computers that help support the network underlying the currency. New Zcash units will be distributed to users until there are 21 million of them in the world. Initially Zcash units are being released slowly \u2014 as of Monday, only about 1,500 were out in the world, helping to feed the speculative frenzy around the currency.\nAdvertisement\nThe concepts behind Zcash were developed by Mr. Green and other academics, but the project is being run by a for-profit Delaware corporation, Zcash Electric Coin Company, which is led by Mr. Wilcox. The corporation, developers and early investors will be compensated by what amounts to a 10 percent charge on all the new Zcash generated by users during the first four years of operation. Some of these coins will also be directed to a nonprofit Zcash foundation.\nThere have already been several efforts beyond Zcash to correct for the privacy shortcomings of Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin users run their coins through so-called tumblers that can obscure the origin of transactions.\nAdvertisement\nAnother relatively new virtual currency, Monero, came with anonymity built into the system. Earlier this year it was seized upon by speculators who pushed up the value of Monero significantly before the price fell back down.

The goal would be to make the financial system more transparent, fast, efficient and secure.\nIf the central banks succeed, it would be one of the greatest unexpected twists in new technology: An invention aimed at dethroning central banks and making it harder for money to be tracked instead ends up empowering those central banks and making money more easily traceable.\nThe Bank of England has produced several research papers on the topic.

Yellen, was asked about the technology at a congressional hearing. She said that \u201cinnovation using these technologies could be extremely helpful and bring benefits to society.\u201d\nThe Fed has been pushed to act by the big banks that it regulates, many of which are experimenting with distributed ledgers as a way to settle trades and record data and transactions. Just last week, JPMorgan Chase said it was moving toward a public release this year of its \u201centerprise grade\u201d blockchain.\nMost financial institutions and central banks are looking at distributed ledgers that would be maintained on the computers of all the major players in the financial system, including the central bank and the biggest financial institutions.\nAdvertisement\nIn the systems being discussed, each player in the system would communicate with all the others anytime money moved in the system, allowing everyone to update the ledgers on their computer systems simultaneously. This would provide multiple backups if the central bank\u2019s computers came under attack. It would also hypothetically allow them to complete transactions much more quickly, and would make it easier to spot rogue actors.\nAdvertisement\nEric Piscini, who oversees work on blockchain by the consulting firm Deloitte, said that a year ago, central banks were looking at the technology mostly because they wanted to understand what private banks were talking about.\nAdvertisement\nNow, he says, the central banks are embracing the technology to revamp their own infrastructures.\nAt the headquarters of the Netherlands\u2019 central bank in Amsterdam, Ron Berndsen set up five laptops to run an experimental virtual currency, derived from the Bitcoin software. The coins issued in the system were nicknamed Dukatons, after a 17th-century silver coin used in the time when the Netherlands was a part of the Spanish Empire.\nMr. Berndsen operated the Dukaton system for three months to see what would happen if the central bank were setting the rules and did not have the same limits as Bitcoin. While the experiment was a success, he is now thinking much bigger and is in constant conversation with other central bank officials who are looking at ways to put their own currencies on distributed ledgers.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThere are so many things going on that it is hard to keep track of all the contacts,\u201d said Mr. Berndsen, the head of market infrastructure at the Dutch central bank. \u201cI hear from other central bank colleagues that it is the same everywhere.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe experimentation so far has taken on many different forms and contemplated many different roles for distributed ledgers to play in the financial system.\nThe Russian national bank said last week that it had worked with a consortium of Russia\u2019s biggest banks to develop its own distributed ledger, which it called Masterchain. The Russian institutions have been sending messages on the system but are also looking at it as a potential \u201ccomponent of the new-generation financial infrastructure in the future.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe Bank of Canada teamed up with the nation\u2019s five largest banks \u2014 and the blockchain consulting firm R3 \u2014 for what was known as Project Jasper. In a simulation run this summer, the central bank issued so-called CAD-Coins onto a blockchain similar to the one that underlies the Bitcoin alternative known as Ethereum.\nThe banks used the CAD-Coins to exchange money \u2014 in this case fictional money \u2014 the way they do at the end of each day to settle their master accounts.\nCarolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said in an interview that while the experiment was a success, a great deal of testing is still necessary before the bank can decide whether distributed ledger technology is ready for the real world.\nAdvertisement\nCritics of blockchain technology have noted the apparent contradiction in central banks\u2019 looking to distributed ledgers.\nAdvertisement\nThe blockchain was created to allow Bitcoin transactions to be recorded communally so that a central authority, such as a central bank, would not be necessary. If a central bank is involved and keeping track, why go to the trouble of keeping records communally?\nThe distributed ledgers being discussed by central bankers also generally lack the openness that has been one of the most attractive attributes of the Bitcoin network.\nAdvertisement\nWith Bitcoin, anyone can join the network and help support it, which has helped it win a following. The distributed ledgers being considered by the financial industry and central banks would generally allow only a small number of registered entities to join in and take part in the network.\nMark Carney, the head of the Bank of England, and perhaps the most prominent champion of distributed ledgers, has said that the technology could be worth using for central banks because it would make for a financial system that does not go down even if the central bank\u2019s computer systems are temporarily taken offline.\nAdvertisement\nThe Bank of England said last month that it wanted the next version of the bank\u2019s basic software infrastructure to be compatible with distributed ledgers.\n", "name": "Central Banks Consider Bitcoin\u2019s Technology, if Not Bitcoin"}, {"text": "This challenge is coming to light with new data privacy rules like the European Union\u2019s general data protection regulation, which will add new consumer data privacy and ownership rights over the next two years.

The American delegation flew to Beijing because that was where much of the Bitcoin power was concentrated.\n\n            The writer, Nathaniel Popper, joined NPR\u2019s Planet Money to explore how a behind-the-scenes fight over Bitcoin spilled out into the real world. You can also hear this episode on iTunes.        \n\nAt the time of the meeting, held at the Grand Hyatt hotel, over 70 percent of the transactions on the Bitcoin network were going through just four Chinese companies, known as Bitcoin mining pools \u2014 and most flowed through just two of those companies. That gives them what amounts to veto power over any changes to the Bitcoin software and technology.\nChina has become a market for Bitcoin unlike anything in the West, fueling huge investments in server farms as well as enormous speculative trading on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges. Chinese exchanges have accounted for 42 percent of all Bitcoin transactions this year, according to an analysis performed for The New York Times by Chainalysis. Just last week, the Chinese internet giant Baidu joined with three Chinese banks to invest in the American Bitcoin company Circle.\nAdvertisement\nBut China\u2019s clout is raising worries about Bitcoin\u2019s independence and decentralization, which was supposed to give the technology freedom from the sort of government crackdowns and interventions that are commonplace in the Chinese financial world.\nThe American companies whose executives journeyed to the Grand Hyatt \u2014 including venture-capital-funded start-ups like Coinbase and Circle \u2014 are fighting to make Bitcoin bigger. They hope to expand the capacity of the Bitcoin network so that it can process more transactions and compete with the PayPals and Visas of the world.\nAdvertisement\nThe current size of the network goes back to the early days, when Bitcoin\u2019s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, limited the amount of data that could travel through the network, essentially capping it at about seven transactions a second. As Bitcoin has grown more popular, those limits have caused severe congestion and led to lengthy transaction delays.\nThe American delegation in China had a software proposal, known as Bitcoin Classic, that would change all that.\nThe Chinese companies, though, had the ultimate decision-making power over any changes in the software, and they did not agree with the American delegation. The Chinese had thrown in their lot with another group of longtime programmers who wanted to keep Bitcoin smaller, in part to keep it more secure. The Americans hoped to persuade the Chinese to switch sides.\nAdvertisement\nIn a hotel conference room, the American team of about a half-dozen people cycled through its PowerPoint slides, in English and Chinese, arguing for expansion of the network, most notably pointing to the long delays that have been plaguing the system as a result of the congestion. The Chinese representatives listened and conferred among themselves. The group took a break for a lunch of lamb and dumplings at a nearby mall.\n\u201cWe kept coming back and saying, \u2018For better or worse, you have this leadership in the industry, and everyone is looking to you to show some leadership,\u2019\u201d said Brian Armstrong, chief executive of Coinbase.\nAdvertisement\nUltimately, Mr. Armstrong said, \u201cWe were unable to convince them.\u201d\nSome Bitcoin advocates have complained that the Chinese companies have been motivated only by short-term profit, rather than the long-term success and ideals of the project. Bobby Lee, chief executive of the Bitcoin company BTCC, which is based in Shanghai, bristled at that \u2014 and at the notion that the Chinese companies represent any sort of united front. He attended the April meeting and pointed out that the Chinese companies had disagreed among themselves on how urgent it was to make changes to the Bitcoin software.\nHe said the American companies failed to understand the power dynamics in the room that day. \u201cIt was almost like imperialistic Westerners coming to China and telling us what to do,\u201d Mr. Lee said in an interview last week. \u201cThere has been a history on this. The Chinese people have long memories.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, released the software in early 2009. It was designed to provide both a digital coin and a new way to move and hold money, much as email had made it possible to send messages without using a postal service.\nFrom the beginning, the system was designed to be decentralized \u2014 operated by all the people who joined their computers to the Bitcoin network and helped process the transactions, much as Wikipedia entries are written and maintained by volunteers around the world.\nThe appeal of a group-run network was that there would be no single point of failure and no company that could shut things down if the police intervened. This was censorship-free money, Bitcoin followers liked to say. Decision-making power for the network resided with the people who joined it, in proportion to the computing power they provided.\nAdvertisement\nThe allure of new riches provided the incentive to join: Every 10 minutes, new Bitcoins would be released and given to one of the computers helping maintain the system. In the lingo of Bitcoin, these computers were said to be mining for currency. They also served as accountants for the network.\nFor the first few years, aside from its use as a payment method on the Silk Road, an online drug market that has since been shut down, Bitcoin failed to gain much traction. It burst into the world\u2019s consciousness in 2013 when the price of the digital money began to spike, in no small part because Chinese investors began trading Bitcoins in large numbers.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Lee said the Chinese took quickly to Bitcoin for several reasons. For one thing, the Chinese government had strictly limited other potential investment avenues, giving citizens a hunger for new assets. Also, Mr. Lee said, the Chinese loved the volatile price of Bitcoin, which gave the fledgling currency network the feeling of online gambling, a very popular activity in China.\nAdvertisement\nThere has been widespread speculation that Chinese people have used Bitcoin to get money out of the country and evade capital controls, but Mr. Lee and other experts said the evidence suggests this is not a significant phenomenon.\n\n            Chinese companies mined about 70 percent of all new Bitcoins produced in the last month. Miners receive Bitcoins and have decision-making power over changes to the Bitcoin software, roughly in proportion to the amount of computing power they devote to the network.        \nShare of Bitcoin mining blocks\nMay 24 to June 24, 2016\nCHINESE COMPANIES\n26.3\n%\nF2Pool\n20.1\nAntpool\n12.6\nBTCC Pool\n11.9\nBW.com\n9.0\nBitFury\n4.8\nSlush\n3.3\nKnCMiner\n4.5\nothers\n7.6\nunknown\nJUNE 29, 2016\n\n\u201cNo Chinese person is pushing for Bitcoin because it\u2019s libertarian or because it\u2019s going to cause the downfall of governments,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who moved to China after growing up in Africa and the United States and studying at Stanford. \u201cThis was an investment.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe extent of the speculative activity in China in late 2013 pushed the price of a single Bitcoin above $1,000. That surge \u2014 and the accompanying media spotlight \u2014 led China\u2019s government to intervene in December 2013 and cut off the flow of money between Chinese banks and Bitcoin exchanges, popping what appeared to be a Bitcoin bubble.\nThe frenzy, though, awakened interest in another aspect of the currency: Bitcoin mining.\nPeter Ng, a former investment manager, is one of the many people in China who moved from trading Bitcoins to amassing computing power to mine them. First, he mined for himself. More recently he has created data centers across China where other people can pay to set up their own mining computers. He now has 28 such centers, all of them filled with endless racks of servers, tangled cords and fans cooling the machines.\nMr. Ng, 36, said he had become an expert in finding cheap energy, often in places where a coal plant or hydroelectric dam was built to support some industrial project that never happened. The Bitcoin mining machines in his facilities use about 38 megawatts of electricity, he said, enough to power a small city.\nThe people who put their machines in Mr. Ng\u2019s data centers generally join mining pools, which smooth the financial returns of smaller players. A popular one, BTCC Pool, is run by Mr. Lee\u2019s company. This month it attracted about 13 percent of the total computational power on the Bitcoin network. The most powerful pool in China \u2014 or anywhere in the world \u2014 is known as F2Pool, and it had 27 percent of the network\u2019s computational power last month.\nBig pool operators have become the kingmakers of the Bitcoin world: Running the pools confers the right to vote on changes to Bitcoin\u2019s software, and the bigger the pool, the more voting power. If members of a pool disagree, they can switch to another pool. But most miners choose a pool based on its payout structure, not its Bitcoin politics.\nAdvertisement\nIt was his role overseeing BTCC Pool that got Mr. Lee invited to the meeting with the American delegation in Beijing. The head of operations at F2Pool, Wang Chun, was also there.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps the most important player in the Chinese Bitcoin world is Jihan Wu, 30, a former investment analyst who founded what is often described in China as the world\u2019s most valuable Bitcoin company. That company, Bitmain, began to build computers in 2013 using chips specially designed to do mining computations.\nBitmain, which has 250 employees, manufactures and sells Bitcoin mining computers. It also operates a pool that other miners can join, called Antpool, and keeps a significant number of mining machines for itself, which it maintains in Iceland and the United States, as well as in China. The machines that Bitmain retains for itself account for 10 percent of the computing power on the global Bitcoin network and are enough to produce new coins worth about $230,000 each day, at the exchange rate last week.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Wu and the other mining pool operators in China have often seemed somewhat surprised, and even unhappy, that their investments have given them decision-making power within the Bitcoin network. \u201cMiners are the hardware guys. Why are you asking us about software?\u201d is the line that Mr. Ng said he often hears from miners.\nThis attitude initially led most Chinese miners to align themselves with old-line Bitcoin coders, known as the core programmers, who have resisted changing the software. The miners wanted to take no risks with the money they were minting.\nBut lately, Mr. Wu has grown increasingly vocal in his belief that the network is going to have to expand, and soon, if it wants to keep its followers. He said in an email last week that if the core programmers did not increase the number of transactions going through the network by July, he would begin looking for alternatives to expand the network.\nAdvertisement\nHowever the software debate goes, there are fears that China\u2019s government could decide, at some point, to pressure miners in the country to use their influence to alter the rules of the Bitcoin network. The government\u2019s intervention in 2013 suggests that Bitcoin is not too small to escape notice.\nMr. Wu dismissed that concern. He also said that as more Americans buy his Bitmain machines and take advantage of cheap power in places like Washington State, mining will naturally become more decentralized. Already, he said, 30 to 40 percent of new Bitmain machines are being shipped out of China.\nAdvertisement\n", "name": "How China Took Center Stage in Bitcoin\u2019s Civil War"}, {"text": "", "name": "Mining for Bitcoin in China"}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "A hacker on Friday siphoned more than $50 million of digital money away from an experimental virtual currency project that had been billed as the most successful crowdfunding venture ever \u2014 taking with him not just a third of the venture\u2019s money but also the hopes and dreams of thousands of participants who wanted to prove the safety and security of digital currency.\nThe D.A.O. was meant to be a standard-bearer for online currency ventures. It was funded by investors from around the world using Ether, which has become popular over the last year. But just before the project stopped raising money in late May, computer scientists pointed out several vulnerabilities in its underlying code \u2014 effectively warning that what happened to the experimental consortium would be possible or even likely.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe D.A.O. is being attacked,\u201d Griff Green, a community organizer with the company that wrote the project\u2019s software, Slock.it, wrote on a chat channel for the project Friday morning. \u201cThis is not a drill.\u201d\nThe money that the hacker moved appeared to be frozen on Friday as a result of a safeguard previously built into the code. The thief was caught in what might be thought of as a digital version of the airtight double doors that sometimes protect valuable sites (known in security circles as man traps).\nAdvertisement\nProgrammers working on the Ethereum network, which hosts Ether, were debating on Friday whether to make a one-time change to the code to recover the frozen money. That faced immediate opposition from many virtual currency purists who were attracted to the technology because of its ostensible freedom from human meddling.\n\u201cThe strength of blockchain tech is that it is a ledger, a statement of truth,\u201d Bruce Fenton, a board member with the Bitcoin Foundation, wrote on Friday. \u201cThat ledger is only as good as its resistance to censorship, change, demands or attack.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIf the leaders of the Ethereum project decide to move forward with a change to the code \u2014 known as a fork \u2014 they will need to win the support of the people who lend their computing power to the network, and who have what amounts to a vote over any changes to the Ethereum software.\nThe hacking on Friday underscored the complicated governance structure employed by so-called cryptocurrencies. These currencies are not run by any company or individual but by the computers of anyone who chooses to support the network.\nThe D.A.O. was supposed to be a further extension of this concept of group decision-making. Thousands of people around the world financed the project by sending in Ether. The D.A.O. was supposed to act as a sort of venture capital fund, investing in projects that were voted upon by people who contributed money. The attack on Friday took place before any projects had been funded.\nThe specific mechanism the hackers used is known as a recursive call vulnerability, \u2014 essentially a malicious transaction that moves money away from the D.A.O. into a side fund in an endlessly repeating loop.\nThe attack led to chaos on the online message boards where D.A.O. investors and Ether users gather.\n\u201cHow can we help and protect our funds?\u201d one user wrote on the Slack chat channel for D.A.O. investors.\nAdvertisement\nThe programmers who wrote the D.A.O. code immediately suggested that investors vote to move their money to another, unrelated project known as Congo Split, primarily to protect their investments.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

In 2014, Mt. Gox, which was previously the largest Bitcoin exchange, announced that it had lost nearly half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin.\nThe attacks on Bitcoin have generally led to a temporary lull in public interest in virtual currencies. But Bitcoin has bounced back each time. Over the last week, the price of Bitcoin has risen swiftly to the highest level since the Mt. Gox fiasco; it stood at $770 on Thursday night.\nAdvertisement\nSome of the recent demand for Bitcoin has come from anticipation of a coming event known as halving. Currently, the Bitcoin software releases 25 new coins \u2014 a block \u2014 every 10 minutes or so to computers helping support the network. In mid-July, the blocks will shrink to 12.5 coins. The shrinking supply has led some to assume that the price will go up.\nAdvertisement\nThe price of Ether had been rising alongside Bitcoin over the last month, in part because of the interest generated by the D.A.O. On Thursday, both were up more than 60 percent over the previous month. But the attack Friday morning sent the price of Ether into a downward spiral.\nBy Friday afternoon, the price of Ether had fallen 33 percent from its high a day earlier, to around $13. Bitcoin had also fallen, though less sharply, to around $750.\nAdvertisement\nThe founder and lead programmer on the Ethereum project, Vitalik Buterin, wrote on Friday that he supported a change to the code that would reclaim the money from the hacker.

Another curator, Alex Van de Sande, a programmer in Brazil, said on Friday that the authors \u201creally raise some interesting attack vectors.\u201d He said he did not see the attacks as an imminent threat, but he was hoping that investors would vote to make the structure of the D.A.O. more secure, potentially by dividing it into several smaller funds.\nAdvertisement\nThe D.A.O. is built on Ethereum, a newer cryptocurrency network that was created to overcome some shortcomings in Bitcoin.The Ethereum system enables so-called smart contracts in which legal agreements can be written into computer code. It is those smart contracts that serve as the basis for decision making and investments within the Decentralized Autonomous Organization. The D.A.O. is motivated in large part by a broader desire to find more decentralized ways to make decisions and financial transactions, with fewer middlemen involved.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the organization began raising funds from investors in April, the surprising level of interest led investors to buy Ether \u2013 the virtual currency in the Ethereum network \u2013 to invest in the D.A.O. That drove up the price of Ether, which in turn drove up the value of Ether invested in the organization.

The price that people were willing to pay for Bitcoin steadily declined for over a year after the bankruptcy.\nBut the problems in Tokyo also led to a professionalization of the virtual currency world, with established entrepreneurs and venture capitalists getting involved and regulators establishing basic rules for businesses in the industry.

Dorian Nakamoto eventually denied being the Bitcoin founder.\nIf Mr. Wright is perpetrating a hoax, it is a rather elaborate one.\nTo back up his claims, the BBC said Mr. Wright had provided digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys inextricably linked to Bitcoins generated by Satoshi Nakamoto. Mr. Wright also posted evidence on his blog, including a technical walk through of how to verify cryptographic keys.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take the decision lightly to make my identity public,\u201d Mr. Wright said in a news release, \u201cand I want to be clear that I\u2019m doing this because I care so passionately about my work.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nSoon after the stories were published in Wired and Gizmodo, the Australian Federal Police raided Mr. Wright\u2019s home in suburban Sydney in connection with a tax investigation. The Australian tax authorities said at the time that they had determined that Mr. Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto.\nGavin Andresen, who succeeded Satoshi Nakamoto as the lead Bitcoin developer, wrote Monday on his blog that he believed Mr. Wright\u2019s claim. Mr. Andresen has pushed for a bigger Bitcoin, a strategy Mr. Wright also appears to back.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAfter spending time with him, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt: Craig Wright is Satoshi,\u201d Mr. Andresen wrote. \u201cDuring our meeting, I saw the brilliant, opinionated, focused, generous \u2014 and privacy-seeking \u2014 person that matches the Satoshi I worked with six years ago.\nBut the Bitcoin community was not in consensus.\nAnother of the leading developers working on Bitcoin\u2019s basic software, Gregory Maxwell, said that the evidence presented by Mr. Wright was not enough to convince him. \u201cIt demonstrates no connection between this person and Bitcoin\u2019s creation,\u201d Mr. Maxwell wrote in an email to the Times.\nA programmer who is in charge of the Bitcoin discussion boards, Michael Marquardt, wrote on Reddit \u2014 under the screen name \u201ctheymos\u201d \u2014 that Mr. Wright\u2019s new writings suggest an effort to deceive the public.

The lack of fresh rules today means that modern fintech start-ups must also adapt to 19th-century regulations.\nAdvertisement\nAnd states have their own rules. In Wyoming, for instance, digital currency start-ups must maintain enormous amounts of capital reserves to operate there.\n\u201cThere is no regulation that is focused specifically on fintech,\u201d said Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a nonprofit advocacy group for digital currencies like Bitcoin. \u201cWhat happens is that there are places where tech has outpaced the law.\u201d\nThe white paper follows some previous efforts by regulators to revise the rules. Last year, the Treasury Department sought information about marketplace lending, which matches borrowers and lenders over the Internet using algorithms.\nAdvertisement\nThis year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau outlined a new policy meant to give start-ups more confidence in introducing financial products without fear of a regulatory rebuke, at least initially.\nAdvertisement\nExisting rules make it difficult to guess which regulations apply to which firms. Take multisignature technology, in which wallets holding digital currencies like Bitcoin have authorization \u201ckeys\u201d held by different parties. No transaction involving that money can take place without the consent of at least two of the key holders.\nAdvertisement\nWhether digital wallet companies can do anything with those deposits in the meantime, as insurance companies do when they invest their unpaid premiums, remains an open question.\nSome big banks, while arguing that they are embracing financial tech, want regulations for the new companies that are equal to what the banks face. Bank of America\u2019s chief executive, Brian Moynihan, said at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this year that disruptions to the payments system would be costly and that regulators must work to ensure that the industry can run smoothly.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Home energy meters with ledgers might buy different sources of energy. Jet engines could record the installation of new parts and pay for maintenance on the spot.\nLike many things in tech, a distributed ledger is a seemingly complex idea that is actually built on a very simple one.\nSince the dawn of record-keeping, ledgers have been where receipts and disbursements of cash and goods are recorded. If you buy a sandwich at a deli, for example, several ledgers come into play. The money you carry to pay for it registers a slight deduction on your personal ledger. The deli owner\u2019s ledger records a gain in one place and in another a payment for the ham it bought from a supplier. A ledger at the bank records the deposit it receives from the deli owner.\nAdvertisement\nIn a world where every business has its own books, payments tend to stop and start between different ledgers. An overseas transfer leaves the ledger of one business, then goes on another ledger at a domestic bank. It then might hit the ledger of a bank in the international transfer system. It travels to another bank in the foreign country, before ending up on the ledger of the company being paid.\nAdvertisement\nEach time it moves to a different ledger, the money has a different identity, taking up time and potentially causing confusion. For some companies, it is a nightmare that can\u2019t end soon enough.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhy should it take me 48 hours to make a foreign currency payment?\u201d said David Morton, chief financial officer of Seagate Technology, a major manufacturer of computer data storage devices. \u201cI have 10,000 suppliers and handle 100,000 invoices a month. If I could pay people immediately, what kind of a discount would I get?\u201d\nIn other words, what if one ledger could be shared among all the people in a transaction, who would agree on a common database of value that would do away with the need for currency exchanges? The actions would be recorded securely, with each participant able to see only the parts he needed to see. None of the middlemen would be needed, and payments could happen much faster.\nThat is the idea behind a distributed ledger. Seagate has invested in Ripple and is testing the technology.\nThe distributed ledger is best known as the underlying system that makes possible Bitcoin, the stateless cryptocurrency. Bitcoin got a bad name as a wildly fluctuating currency for drug dealers and tax cheats, in part because its participants remained anonymous. But many banks and businesses say the underlying ledger technology, if it is secure and transparent, can be more efficient than our current methods.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBanks are struggling with different regulations, fragmented systems and siloed practices,\u201d said Owen Jelf, global managing director for capital markets at Accenture, which has also worked with Ripple. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about this as a technology to make things more efficient.\u201d\nAccenture has made several bets on the technology.

Following Bitcoin\u2019s lead, Mr. Larsen also worked on developing his own currency, called XRP. But he later decided to incorporate XRP into his ledger technology as a way to improve the existing international system, instead of overwhelming it with a new cryptocurrency.\nHe appears to have decided he will have more success by working with authorities on the existing problems of global transactions than on a new currency like Bitcoin, whose fans favor major disruption. \u201cA lot of financial technology is foolhardy,\u201d Mr. Larsen said. \u201cSaying, \u2018We\u2019re going to kill banks.

He graduated from Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1991.\nAdvertisement\nFive years later, he started E-Loan, one of the first online mortgage companies. He took it public, but left in 2005 to start Prosper Marketplace, a peer-to-peer lending operation that, after initial regulatory clashes over lending laws, has facilitated several billion dollars\u2019 worth of loans.\nHe left Prosper in 2012 to work on XRP and a global ledger system open to everyone trading anything that two people agreed was worth something \u2014 goats, money, labor, you name it.\nAdvertisement\nHe started Ripple, originally Ripple Labs, in 2013.

The Bitcoin technology, which first emerged in 2009, has been promoted as a way to quickly and cheaply move money across national borders without using traditional money-transmitting services such as Western Union.\nCircle is set up so that its customers can hold their money in national currencies to avoid the volatile price of Bitcoin. When a customer wants to move money, he or she can buy Bitcoin for the short period of time required to send the money or simply move dollars or pounds from a linked bank account.\nThe British license will allow Circle customers to instantly transfer money between dollars and British pounds \u2014 and soon enough, between those currencies and euros, given that the e-money license is valid across the European Union.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cFor the first time any consumer in the U.S. and the U.K. will be able to beam sterling and dollars back and forth, instantly for free,\u201d said Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder of Circle. \u201cThat\u2019s just never been possible.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIt is a difficult moment for the virtual currency.

In addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts.\nThe system is complicated enough that even people who know it well have trouble describing it in plain English. But one application in development would let farmers put their produce up for sale directly to consumers and take payment directly from consumers. There are already dozens of functioning applications built on Ethereum, enabling new ways to manage and pay for electricity, sports bets and even Ponzi schemes.\nAll of this work is still very early. The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin.\nAdvertisement\nMany Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system.\nAdvertisement\nBut the sophisticated capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate America. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way to control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things.\nMicrosoft has been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on its computing cloud, Azure.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cEthereum is a general platform where you can solve problems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution \u2014 the most elegant solution we have seen to date,\u201d said Marley Gray, a director of business development and strategy at Microsoft.\nMr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft\u2019s work with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced.

That has brought the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any virtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value outstanding last week.\nSince Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-called alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the following of Ethereum.\nUnlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more transparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after he dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario.\nAdvertisement\nThe most basic aim of Ethereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the blockchain \u2014 the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could program a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the final score came in from a mutually agreed upon source \u2014 say, The Associated Press \u2014 the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party. Ether can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary to pay for the network power needed to process the bet.\nThe Ethereum system has sometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the network of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by Ether.\nAdvertisement\nA team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software after he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin\u2019s team raised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the Ethereum Foundation, which supports the software\u2019s development.\nAdvertisement\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have helped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase in value if the system succeeds.

But it has exposed fundamental differences about the basic aims of the Bitcoin project, and how online communities should be governed. The two camps have broadly painted each other as, on one side, populists who are focused on expanding Bitcoin\u2019s commercial potential and, on the other side, elitists who are more concerned with protecting its status as a radical challenger to existing currencies.\nThe divide has led over the last six months to death threats against Bitcoin developers and hacking attacks that have taken down Internet providers. The sense of betrayal is strong on both sides. One of Mr. Hearn\u2019s primary antagonists, a bearded California-based programmer named Gregory Maxwell, also appears to have pulled back from his work on Bitcoin after receiving anonymous death threats.\nThese internal struggles have surfaced at the same time that the Bitcoin technology is gaining credibility on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley. Throughout the various controversies that have plagued the virtual currency \u2014 including many instances of theft and fraud \u2014 the basic software has continued working as expected. That consistency has pushed the value of all outstanding Bitcoins above $6 billion and led many venture capitalists to imagine the technology as the future of finance, a cheaper and faster way to carry out financial transactions of all sorts.\nAdvertisement\nPart of the basic appeal of Bitcoin has been its promise to provide a more reliable and trustworthy alternative to existing currencies and financial networks. Unlike the Federal Reserve and Wall Street, institutions that are managed by humans, Bitcoin was supposed to rest on the infallible logic of math and computer code. In this system, programmers like Mr. Hearn, who often volunteered their expertise and effort, were viewed as neutral technicians.\nAdvertisement\nThe current dispute, though, is a reminder that the Bitcoin software \u2014 like all computer code \u2014 is an evolving product of the human mind, and its deployment is vulnerable to human frailties and divergent ideals.\nAdvertisement\nThere may yet be a middle ground on the question that began the fight, but for the moment the sides are deadlocked, and that has left the Bitcoin software \u2014 and the virtual currency itself \u2014 in a state of limbo. Mr. Hearn is convinced that the stalemate will soon make it hard to complete even simple transactions and will eventually drive away users and lead to a price collapse. Mr. Hearn\u2019s concerns about this impasse have been echoed, often in less strident tones, by a growing number of other developers, as well as by start-ups that buy, sell and hold Bitcoins.\nAdvertisement\nGavin Andresen, a close collaborator of Mr. Hearn\u2019s and one of the longest-standing contributors to the Bitcoin software, said the dispute was likely to cause disruptions in the short term, but he disagrees with the notion that it will damage Bitcoin\u2019s long-term prospects. Other Bitcoin leaders have expressed a similar sentiment, and investors have been inclined to believe them: The price of a Bitcoin has actually risen in recent months, to about $430 this week.\nSome of Mr. Hearn\u2019s allies in the battle are hoping the deadlock can be broken if the largest Bitcoin companies get behind something like Bitcoin Classic, a new version of the basic Bitcoin software that was announced this week, and that aims to expand the network\u2019s capacity while also introducing new standards of governance.\nBut Mr. Hearn is convinced it is already too late. During nighttime walks in the woods near his apartment in Zurich, he has been trying to figure out where Bitcoin went wrong and what it means for the idealistic beliefs that led him to the project in the first place.\n\u201cIt never occurred to me that the thing could just fall apart because of people getting crazy and having fundamental political disagreements over the goals of the project,\u201d Mr. Hearn said in a Skype interview from his apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s really shaken my faith in humanity.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMr. Hearn, 31, grew up in Manchester, England, where he played music and went rock climbing in his free time. He was one of the first serious programmers to take an interest in Bitcoin, back in April 2009, just a few months after its mysterious founder, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, let it loose in the world.\nAdvertisement\nAt the time, Mr. Hearn was working on mapping software at Google, a job he\u2019d had since graduating from Durham University, in England. He had no professional involvement with finance or currencies, but the financial crisis convinced him that national currencies were vulnerable to politics and bad decision-making. When a web search led him to the primitive website for Bitcoin, he immediately emailed Satoshi, as the founder had become known.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cSo many questions,\u201d Mr. Hearn wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s rare that I encounter truly revolutionary ideas.\u201d\nLike many of the programmers who took an early interest, Mr. Hearn admired the rule-bound nature of the system. Only 21 million Bitcoins would ever be created. And the distribution of new Bitcoins was clearly laid out, relying on mathematical algorithms that left no room for human meddling.\nAdvertisement\nSatoshi had written the software containing these rules, but after it was released, anyone could see the code and make changes. The people downloading this open-source software essentially voted on which changes to accept based on which version of the software they chose to use. If Satoshi proposed changes that they didn\u2019t like, they didn\u2019t have to download and run it, and anyone could offer an alternative. Bitcoin, like many other open-source projects, was a sort of leaderless democracy \u2014 a new way of governing human behavior online. One computer, one vote, with anyone able to propose new laws.\nIt took a while for Bitcoin to catch on, but by late 2010, when Mr. Hearn started contributing to the code, the currency had begun developing a passionate following. The apparently leaderless structure and seamless functioning of the software won Bitcoin renown among libertarians and anarchists, and soon enough, among entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, drawn to the transparent, mathematical foundations of the project.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Hearn joined a small but growing group of volunteers who worked on the basic Bitcoin software from various corners of the globe \u2014 the most committed of whom became known as the core developers. They met in person only a handful of times, but they would chat constantly online and send emails discussing potential changes. The leader of this effort, after Satoshi bowed out in 2011 (without ever revealing a real identity), was Mr. Andresen, a genial father of two from central Massachusetts who kept everyone on the same page.\nMr. Hearn was always a bit different from the rest of the core developers. Whereas most of them were classic techies, with patchy facial hair and ill-fitting clothes, the clean-cut Mr. Hearn had a taste for fashionable jeans and skateboard shoes \u2014 as well as an easy sociability. Within Google, Mr. Hearn became an informal spokesman for Bitcoin, answering queries from the Google co-founder Sergey Brin and leading an in-house email list discussion group that had attracted 400 employees by the time Mr. Hearn left.\nMr. Hearn was also, along with Mr. Andresen, of a practical mind-set, most interested in improving the basic experience of holding and using Bitcoins. He was not given to making the big pronouncements common to the more ideological members of the community, about the currency displacing the dollar or euro. He was more focused on the immediate challenges that could trip it up.\nAdvertisement\nWhen tension cropped up among the developers, Mr. Andresen kept the peace by brokering compromises.\nThe bonhomie began to fall apart last year because of what appeared to be a positive development: the continuing growth in the number of Bitcoin users and transactions.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address. Please re-enter.\nYou must select a newsletter to subscribe to.\nView all New York Times newsletters.\nThe problem was that, early on, Satoshi established a limit on the number of transactions that could be processed by the network every 10 minutes. The cap was meant to ensure that the computers supporting the network, and processing the transactions, would not be overwhelmed by an enormous quantity of data. But Satoshi had suggested that the limit should be temporary, and as the number of transactions coursing through the network inched closer to the cap, delays started to occur and transactions were not going through.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Mr. Hearn began pushing for changes to the core Bitcoin software to allow for larger blocks of transaction data, he faced immediate resistance. Gregory Maxwell, a largely self-taught programmer who had worked on Wikipedia and the Mozilla web browser, both open-source projects, said that larger blocks of transaction data would be harder for ordinary computers to process. The result, Mr. Maxwell warned, would be to hand control over the network to big companies that could afford powerful computers.\nFor Mr. Maxwell, slower transactions seemed to be a secondary issue to protecting Bitcoin from centralized sources of authority.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s far from clear to me that the world will get a second shot at this in the next several decades if Bitcoin lapses into the same-old, same-old,\u201d he wrote to other developers.\nMr. Hearn retorted that the technical issue wasn\u2019t such a big deal; ordinary computers could mostly process the larger blocks of transaction data. More important, he argued, was that Bitcoin needed to succeed first as a cheaper, faster payment network, like PayPal or Visa. If Bitcoin wanted to ever compete with mainstream payment systems, which could process tens of thousands of transactions a second, it would have to do away with Bitcoin\u2019s existing limit of fewer than seven transactions a second.\nThe debate was complicated by the financial interests of the people involved. Mr. Maxwell and several of his supporters were then working for a Bitcoin start-up called Blockstream, with $21 million in funding from venture capitalists. Mr. Maxwell\u2019s start-up was trying to make it possible to break off some transactions from the Bitcoin network, making the number of transactions the network could handle less important.\nAfter leaving Google, Mr. Hearn had begun taking a salary for his Bitcoin work from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most prominent supporters of Bitcoin start-ups in Silicon Valley.\nAdvertisement\nAs the debate grew increasingly fractious, friendships among the core developers fell apart.\nIn the past, the leader of the Bitcoin software project, Mr. Andresen (no relation to Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz), would have stepped in to mediate. Mr. Andresen says that as \u201clead maintainer\u201d he always sought consensus, but on the few occasions when there was irresolvable disagreement, he made the final call, acting as a sort of \u201cbenevolent dictator.\u201d But Mr. Andresen stepped back from his day-to-day role in 2014 and gave the job of lead maintainer to another volunteer on the project, Wladimir J. van der Laan, a Dutch programmer, who said he did not intend to follow Mr. Andresen\u2019s lead.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI cannot be the decider for network-level issues,\u201d Mr. van der Laan said via email this week. \u201cNo one \u2018owns\u2019 Bitcoin. No one can decide over Bitcoin as if it\u2019s some kind of company.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen ultimately decided late in the summer that the only way forward was to give the vote to the people actually using the Bitcoin software. They put together their own version of the core software \u2014 largely the same as the current software, but with an allowance for more transactions \u2014 which they called Bitcoin XT. If a clear majority of the system\u2019s users downloaded the software, it would become the new law of the land \u2014 what is known in open-source terminology as a fork.\nForks are part of the open-source process and had been used to make small, agreed-upon fixes to Bitcoin. But no one had tried the sort of divisive fork that Mr. Hearn and Mr. Andresen devised, largely because of the risk that it could result in two incompatible Bitcoin networks and create questions about the legitimacy and value of existing Bitcoins.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cSo this is it. Here we are. The community is divided, and Bitcoin is forking,\u201d Mr. Hearn wrote on Aug. 15, announcing the new software.\nThe release of Bitcoin XT was viewed by Mr. van der Laan and Mr. Maxwell as an act of betrayal. Yes, it was democratic, but they said that decisions about the core software should be made by technical experts \u2014 not by populist campaigns.\nIn an interview with Vice a few days after the announcement, Mr. Maxwell compared the Bitcoin XT team to a \u201cguy standing on the sidelines with a beer cup hat.\u201d One of Mr. Maxwell\u2019s confidants likened it to an attempted coup. Their supporters blocked Mr. Hearn\u2019s announcement of Bitcoin XT \u2014 and any discussion of it \u2014 from the Bitcoin.org website and several other online forums where Bitcoin members met to discuss the project.\nAdvertisement\nThe fight took on a new dimension when a powerful hacker distributed Bitkiller, malicious software that sought out computers that downloaded the Bitcoin XT software and overwhelmed them with traffic. One Internet provider on Long Island said the Bitkiller attacks brought down service for part of southern Long Island for several hours. The biggest American Bitcoin company, Coinbase, was taken entirely off-line for brief periods after declaring support for XT. Not surprisingly, this scared away many Bitcoin users from downloading the new software or even declaring support for it.\nAdvertisement\nThe hacker responsible for the attack, who appeared to be based in Russia, told Mr. Hearn in an online exchange that someone \u201cpayed me for killing XT\u201d \u2014 though he declined to say who was responsible.\nAdvertisement\nIn the late fall, Mr. Maxwell and his supporters tried to engineer a compromise. They organized meetings in Montreal and Hong Kong where the leading developers met to discuss alternative ways to scale the Bitcoin system. Mr. Andresen went to the first of these, where Mr. Maxwell\u2019s allies announced their own, more gradual plan for increasing the network\u2019s capacity. But Mr. Andresen and Mr. Hearn both felt that the recommendations didn\u2019t go far enough. Mr. Andresen, who is not normally given to sniping, began to harden his position.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely that the current developers will get fired, and some other team will replace them because they are not listening to their customers,\u201d he said in an interview last week.\nMr. Maxwell was equally dismissive of Mr. Hearn\u2019s camp \u2014 saying that they had politicized what should have been a technical decision. Then he suddenly dropped out of the conversation in mid-December. He has not explained his absence, but colleagues say he was tired of the rancor.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Andresen said a number of large Bitcoin companies had been asking him to come back in and lead a new version of the Bitcoin software. But if he did return to his old role, he said, he would insist on clear rules about decision-making.\nMr. Hearn says he thinks that getting the opposing camps together will now be very difficult. He believes that the dangers of the current impasse have not been reflected in the price of Bitcoin because the full debate has been censored in many of the online forums where Bitcoin is discussed.\n", "name": "A Bitcoin Believer\u2019s Crisis of Faith"}, {"text": "\u201cThe deal would need to improve materially for us to get involved,\u201d said one executive at a financial firm, who has been looking at putting money into Ms. Masters\u2019s company, speaking on the condition of anonymity because negotiations were continuing. \u201cIt\u2019s not supercompelling.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nDigital Asset Holdings\u2019 head of business development, Beth Shah, said assertions that the company was facing challenges in raising funds were inaccurate but she declined to provide further details. All of the potential investors declined to comment.\nThe challenges that Ms. Masters is facing reflect in part the increasingly difficult environment facing start-ups of all sorts as investors have begun to worry that the tech industry has been overhyped and overvalued, pushing down values for companies both public and private.\nShe is also contending with the difficulty of building a viable business around the virtual currency Bitcoin and the various technological concepts it has introduced to the financial industry, most of all the blockchain.\nAdvertisement\nThe blockchain is the database on which all transactions on the Bitcoin network are recorded. Unlike normal databases, the blockchain is maintained by everyone using the database in a decentralized fashion. That has led many in the financial industry to hail it as a faster \u2014 and more reliable \u2014 alternative to existing transaction systems.\nAdvertisement\nDigital Asset Holdings is proposing to build something similar to the blockchain database, in order to provide a cheaper and faster way to trade other sorts of financial assets, such as loans and foreign currencies.\nAdvertisement\nThe problem for Ms. Masters is that several other start-ups are trying to do something similar, and there is no guarantee that any of the start-ups will ultimately succeed. Many industry experts think that it could take years to get to the point where the blockchain technology can be used effectively by banks \u2014 if it works at all.\nThe New York-based start-up ItBit, which is building its own blockchain-like technology, had been out trying to raise $100 million based on the assumption that the company was worth $250 million. More recently, it has scaled that back and is now hoping to get $50 million from investors, with a valuation of $135 million.\nMs. Masters hopes to raise from $35 million to $45 million, valuing the company at $100 million.\nDigital Asset Holdings is a relative newcomer to the area. It grew out of a Bitcoin trading operation created by the Chicago trading firm DRW, which operated through a little-known subsidiary of DRW known as Cumberland Mining & Materials.\nAdvertisement\nThe founder of DRW, Don Wilson, helped recruit Ms. Masters, 46, to Digital Asset Holdings this year. Ms. Masters, Oxford-born and Cambridge-educated, had worked at JPMorgan for nearly three decades.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

But Ms. Masters left JPMorgan in 2014 after a unit in the commodities business she headed was accused of manipulating electricity prices. Ms. Masters was not accused of wrongdoing, and the bank has said that her departure was not tied to the regulatory problems.\nAdvertisement\nSoon after Ms. Masters joined Digital Asset Holdings, known as D.A., this past spring, the company began working with the investment bank Sandler O\u2019Neill to raise money. Within the company, there was an expectation that the fund-raising would be finished by the fall, according to people briefed on the situation.\nAt the same time, though, D.A. was trying to figure out its product. Initially, it was looking at creating financial services tied to Bitcoin itself, including a sliver of a Bitcoin that would maintain the value of a dollar. On the wall of the offices there was a screen showing the price of the virtual currency, according to people who were at the offices.\nAdvertisement\nBut not long after Ms. Masters arrived, the Bitcoin chart came down and Digital Asset Holdings began to talk about developing databases similar to the one that Bitcoin had introduced, but not connected to Bitcoin itself.\nMs. Masters secured most of the company\u2019s top programming talent by buying smaller start-ups already working in that area, firms with names like Hyperledger, Blockstack and Bits of Proof.\nAdvertisement\nIn recent months, the software that Ms. Masters has shown to potential investors allows for the issuance and trading of so-called syndicated loans \u2014 large loans broken into pieces and sold to different investors. It can take weeks for trades in this market to go through, a time span that D.A. is trying to shorten.\nInvestors who have looked at the software, though, say they are not convinced that Ms. Masters\u2019s technology will fix the problems in the loan market, which are attributed as much to human cooperation as to bad software.\nAdvertisement\nThere are also indications that Digital Asset Holdings has not had an easy time integrating all the outside technology start-ups it bought. For example, two of the three employees who worked at Blockstack, which the company acquired in October, have already negotiated to leave D.A., people briefed on the situation said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAll employees who were offered permanent positions at the time of the acquisitions of Bits of Proof, Hyperledger and Blockstack are still with the company,\u201d said Ms. Shah.\nOne of Ms. Masters\u2019s competitors, known as R3, has approached the problem from a different angle and is trying to determine how the banks want to use the blockchain before building specific software. With that strategy, R3 has signed on over 40 banks as partners in recent months, including all of the big banks that Ms. Masters is trying to persuade to invest in her company.\nNone of this has scared off JPMorgan, which has agreed to lead the Series A investment round in Digital Asset Holdings, people briefed on the negotiations said. To reward JPMorgan, the people said, D.A. plans to grant it warrants to buy a bigger share of the start-up in the future at the same price it is getting now. JPMorgan is said to have committed to helping Ms. Masters\u2019s company improve and secure adoption of its technology.\n", "name": "Start-Up With Bitcoin in Its DNA Stumbles on Fund-Raising Trail"}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nYahoo was going to spin off its multibillion-dollar stake in Alibaba, then decided it would probably make more economic sense to just spin itself off.

To me, the biggest surprise here is that people still care about Bitcoin.\nAdvertisement\nFarhad: Yes, the effort to unmask the creator of Bitcoin gave me flashbacks to 2013. But now that the articles in Wired and Gizmodo already seem to be falling apart, I\u2019m a bit more interested. By which I mean, I am not totally asleep.\nAdvertisement\nMike: I do want to talk a bit about digital currency. This week, Walmart announced that it was also jumping into the fray of digital wallets and would offer its customers a way to pay for stuff at its stores using Walmart\u2019s own app. It\u2019s called Walmart Pay \u2014 a wildly creative title \u2014 and is basically an extension of Walmart\u2019s already successful mobile app.\nAdvertisement\nIt is based on QR-code technology, which is pretty similar to bar code scanning in retail stores. When customers get to the Walmart checkout line, they open the app and present a digital code to the cashier. That code is connected with a payment method \u2014 a credit card or Walmart gift card, for example \u2014 and is used to pay for their stuff.\nNow, I have a lot of thoughts on the complications of this, but I would like to let you go first, mostly so I can knock down all of your terrible arguments.\nFarhad: I\u2019ve got to say, I don\u2019t really get this move. Sure, I understand why Walmart wants to be in the payments game. It has been leading the fight against credit card companies over \u201cswipe fees\u201d \u2014 the fraction of each purchase that Walmart pays Visa and MasterCard when customers use credit cards. The app helps in that fight. By linking directly to your bank account, Walmart could bypass credit card processors when you shop there.\nAdvertisement\nBut that is only if a lot of people use it. And does anybody think that will happen? I am very skeptical. I\u2019m one of the most tech-obsessed nerds around, but I barely ever use Apple Pay when I\u2019m out shopping. Sure, it may be a bit faster to pull out my phone than my credit card, but the difference is so slight that I don\u2019t really see the point. And Walmart\u2019s QR-code idea sounds like a bigger headache still. Why would anyone use that over a plain old credit card?\nMike: So you\u2019re scratching at a problem that Apple and Google are still trying to solve. That is to say, some people think it\u2019s a solution in search of a problem. We have spent decades swiping cards with little problem, so it will take decades more to change that behavior.\nAdvertisement\nDo I think a QR code will be the way to change it? No way. It\u2019s clunky. You have to persuade people to take out their phones, open the app, scan it and so on. Apple can barely convince people to wave their smartphone over a payment terminal. And for about five years now, Google has not convinced anyone to do anything.\nAdvertisement\nA slightly wonky aside: Walmart was leading the charge on MCX, another QR-code-based payments app created by merchants who wanted to bypass credit card networks and increase their profit margin. Walmart effectively ditching MCX, and all of its other large merchant partners, to work on its own code-based system is basically calling the whole thing a huge embarrassing failure. And to be fair to Walmart, it definitely was.\nHere\u2019s the bull case: Walmart has some 22 million people using its app already. I think that\u2019s even more than Starbucks\u2019s app, which is hugely successful. So if you can funnel all of those people who already use the Walmart app to search for coupons and buy things via their phones into opening that app at the register, bully for them!\nAdvertisement\nStill, that\u2019s a big if. And, as I have said before, QR codes are so lame. But who knows? I certainly won\u2019t count them out quite yet.\nFarhad: Do you know what would be truly useful? Imagine if the app didn\u2019t just help you pay at checkout, but also let you scan all your goods as you took them off the shelf \u2014 allowing you to complete your purchase from anywhere in the store, and bypass the checkout lines entirely. Sure, there are some security issues with this idea, but there are ways around them. I know because one of Walmart\u2019s tech executives showed me a pilot-test of this idea in a Silicon Valley store a few years ago.

They are, instead, looking at the network and software that make it possible for Bitcoin to move around the world instantly, and almost free.\nUntil now, digital transactions have always gone through some sort of central authority that can move the money and update the records on both sides \u2014 as PayPal and Visa do for many online purchases.\nThe Bitcoin network, on the other hand, is run by a decentralized network of users who jointly keep track of transactions and update the records in real time, with no single user or company in charge. The records of all transactions are kept on a public ledger \u2014 essentially just a big, publicly available spreadsheet \u2014 known as the blockchain that is visible to anyone and has, at least so far, proven impossible to tamper with.\nAdvertisement\nMuch of the work being done inside banks, and in other industries, is looking at whether the blockchain technology can be used independent of the Bitcoin virtual currency, which was the first thing to be recorded on the blockchain ledger.\nAdvertisement\nThe music publication Billboard recently wrote about how several start-ups are aiming to use a digital ledger like the blockchain to keep track of musical downloads and distribute the royalties to artists without relying on a central record keeper.\nVermont\u2019s state government commissioned a study in June to look at how a blockchain could be used as a legal method of record keeping under state law; it is one of several governments, many of them outside the United States, looking at the technology.\nBut the most intense work is being done by financial companies like the Nasdaq OMX Group, which has several programmers in Manhattan preparing software that the company plans to roll out this year.\nAdvertisement\nThe Nasdaq software will allow the trading of stocks in private companies, like tech start-ups, on a new kind of blockchain.

At Citigroup, for instance, there are six different in-house experiments, building software that harnesses the blockchain technology, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s work. In one test, the bank has created its own virtual currency, Citicoin, that employees can experiment with.\nAside from Nasdaq\u2019s project, there is much debate about where the technology is likely to gain its first real world use. At Barclays, some of the 20 internal experiments \u2014 most of them conducted at two Barclays offices in London dedicated to the technology \u2014 are looking at ways to use the blockchain to speed up and lower the cost of consumer payments, to compete with credit cards and direct money transfers.\nAdvertisement\nBut bankers generally say that most of the work is aimed at changing the systems that big Wall Street traders and investors use to buy and sell sophisticated assets like syndicated loans and corporate bonds.\nAdvertisement\nBecause any innovation in this area would require the cooperation of multiple banks, the banks have had joint meetings to discuss how they could work together, often led by outside start-ups looking to provide the software.\nOne of the most advanced of those conversations has been coordinated by a start-up known as R3Cev that is led by a former Wall Street executive, David E. Rutter. R3Cev has put together models for how banks could trade foreign currencies on a communally maintained spreadsheet like the blockchain, according to people briefed on the project. It was R3Cev that convened the April meeting at Bank of America, which was attended by more than 75 people from 15 financial institutions, these people said.\nAdvertisement\nThis can seem like rather esoteric business, but these are the markets where huge amounts of money turn over each day, and these markets influence the profits of the largest financial institutions.

Mr. Neukirchen, at JPMorgan, is one of many bankers who expect that it will take a few years for the first significant use of blockchain technology to gain traction. Mr. White at Barclays expects it even sooner, in the next year.\nThe prospect of banks capitalizing on the technology can be disappointing to early Bitcoin adherents, many of whom were drawn to the technology because it provided a way to move and store money that did not rely on banks.\nAdvertisement\nMany in the financial industry hope they can find a way to use the blockchain concept \u2014 what is often referred to as a distributed ledger \u2014 without using the blockchain associated with Bitcoin.\n", "name": "Bitcoin Technology Piques Interest on Wall St."}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "Both Mr. Murgio and his lawyer declined to comment after the proceeding in federal court.\nFederal authorities contend that Mr. Murgio\u2019s company, Coin.mx, allowed online criminals to illegally exchange the digital currency bitcoin for cash as part of a money-laundering scheme.

The third defendant, Joshua Samuel Aaron, is an American citizen living in Israel who is thought to have been in Russia recently, but he has not yet been arrested.\nAdvertisement\nThe indictment is a bare-bones set of allegations that gives few details about how the shares were manipulated. A statement by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, asserts that the defendants funneled \u201cmillions of dollars in unlawful proceeds through a web of international shell companies.\u201d But the indictment itself has nothing about how much money they made from the scheme or the amount of losses that investors suffered.

In an interesting twist, Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev attended Florida State University with Mr. Aaron, the missing defendant in the penny-stock case who was last thought to be in Russia.\nThe penny-stock defendants are accused of using accounts for Cyprus-based shell companies to launder the profits from the stock sales. The complaint against the Bitcoin exchange defendants describes using accounts in Cyprus, Hong Kong and Eastern Europe for their transactions. Mr. Murgio is also accused of taking control of a credit union in New Jersey to process transactions, showing the vulnerability of domestic financial institutions to misuse.\nThis all may be just a grand coincidence, but it shows the web of connections in the world of online crime and the challenges that investigators face when they try to build cases.

The complaint suggested that the criminals also used the site to launder their proceeds.\nAdvertisement\nIn a separate set of recent cases, security experts said, several financial firms have been attacked by a criminal, or circle of criminals, going by the name DD4BC, who have threatened to overwhelm the firms\u2019 public websites with message traffic unless a Bitcoin payment was made. These corporate victims are generally asked to pay about $10,000, the security experts said, and the attacks have shown no signs of abating.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cDo not ignore me, as it will just increase the price,\u201d DD4BC said in one email that was made public. \u201cOnce you pay me you are free from me for the lifetime of your site.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nTed Weisberg, the president of the brokerage firm Seaport Securities, which was hit in June, said that he initially thought the message was a joke. But as he called competitors, he said, he quickly learned that the threat was real. Seaport\u2019s website ended up being down for a day and a half. Mr. Weisberg\u2019s firm did not pay the ransom and repelled the bombardment of traffic with the help of one of its technical providers.\nThe extortion attempts have been widespread enough that the brokerage industry\u2019s self-governing regulatory agency, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, warned its members in June to contact the F.B.I. if they received a message from DD4BC.\nRansom payments entered the digital world long before Bitcoin came on the scene. Previously, though, the methods for paying attackers could be cumbersome and risky for the extortionist. A credit card payment or bank transfer could easily be traced by the police, so the victims were usually asked to buy prepaid cards like Green Dot\u2019s MoneyPak. Partly because of their use by swindlers, these cards were recently taken off the market.\nAdvertisement\nBitcoin has made the delivery of ransom more seamless and untraceable for criminals because the virtual currency system is run by a decentralized network of computers that collects no personal information about users. Unlike the days of bulging briefcases, Bitcoin payments can be made without an in-person meeting. What\u2019s more, Bitcoin transactions are designed to be irreversible, so victims cannot reclaim their money as they could with a credit card or PayPal transaction.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

But in late 2013, the threat spread far beyond the virtual currency community when the first version of Bitcoin-fueled ransomware, known as CryptoLocker, began to spread around the globe.\nAdvertisement\nThe software encrypted all of the files on a computer and offered a key to unlock the files in exchange for a Bitcoin payment. Victims were directed to several websites where they could buy Bitcoins through a bank transfer.\nWhen an alliance of international authorities took down CryptoLocker in mid-2014 and identified the mastermind as a 30-year-old Russian named Evgeniy Bogachev, the group said that the software had spread to 234,000 computers. Since then, much more virulent strains have popped up, most of them under the name CryptoWall, and spread even more widely to the computers of anyone who opened infected attachments.\nAdvertisement\nThe authorities have had trouble estimating the number of victims because many do not report their problem and quietly pay the price. But in late 2014, Dell SecureWorks said CryptoWall had infected over 800,000 computers. New versions of the malware, going by names like TorrentLocker and Dirty Decrypt, have popped up frequently since then.\nA police department in Durham, N.H., that was hit by CryptoWall in June 2014, refused to hand over the ransom and was able to revert to backup files. But more recently, police departments in Dickson County, Tenn., and Tewksbury, Mass., have said that they chose to pay the roughly $500 ransom rather than deal with the headache of trying to circumvent the hackers.\nAdvertisement\nBeyond these attacks, extortionists went after two longtime Bitcoin advocates last year, threatening to exploit personal information about the men\u2019s families if they did not pay up.\nWhen one of the men, Hal Finney, refused to submit, the assailant called the local police and reported a murder at Mr. Finney\u2019s home, resulting in a SWAT team taking over the home, the family has said. The other victim, Roger Ver, threw off his attacker by offering a Bitcoin bounty of roughly $20,000 for his attacker\u2019s arrest.\n", "name": "For Ransom, Bitcoin Replaces the Bag of Bills "}, {"text": "At least three of the people charged apparently knew one another for at least a decade, going back to when they were students at Florida State University.

The person said it was possible the actual hacking was done by others in Eastern Europe on the instructions of those overseeing the stock pump-and-dump scheme.\nWhile many questions remain, what is clear is that federal authorities were forced to move much sooner than they had wanted, partly out of concern that the investigation was becoming too public and that some of those charged might try to move to countries with no formal extradition process to the United States.\nOn July 2, federal prosecutors sent a letter to Israeli authorities asking them to arrest three men charged with running a four-year stock manipulation scheme as soon as one of the men returned home to Tel Aviv from a trip outside the country. Prosecutors said they were concerned about news organizations making public some aspects of the investigation.\n\n                The Justice Department asked Israel to arrest three men charged with running a stock manipulation scheme.            \nIn the letter, the prosecutors said a United States judge had issued arrest warrants for the men on June 2, after a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted the three on 11 counts of securities fraud in a sealed indictment.

An Israeli judge ordered both of them to remain in custody pending a hearing on Aug. 10. Mr. Aaron, 31, who was born in the United States and grew up in Maryland, lives in Tel Aviv.\nIn the letter to Israeli authorities, federal prosecutors said that in the past \u201cShalon caused the massive quantity of spam emails to be transmitted through his and Aaron\u2019s control of numerous servers, domain names, email accounts and accounts with third-party email distribution companies under Shalon\u2019s control.\u201d\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

In 2012, then living in Tallahassee, Mr. Murgio filed for bankruptcy, claiming he had $545,000 in debts.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Aaron, who majored in real estate, left Florida State in 2005 without a degree, a university spokesman said. For a time he ran a small business called Josh Aaron L.L.C. out of his parents\u2019 home in Potomac, Md., before moving to Israel.\nFederal prosecutors contend that Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev went into the Bitcoin money exchange business in 2013, providing a platform for criminals who put malicious malware on computers and then demand a ransom payment in Bitcoin to unfreeze those computers.\nAdvertisement\nThe prosecutors said Mr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev sought to conceal their money transfer activities by taking effective control of a small credit union in New Jersey that mainly served low-income members.\nThey did not identify the credit union, but people briefed on the matter said it is Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union in Jackson, N.J.

For instance, many people were willing to compromise the purity and power of the code for the convenience of having someone else handle the work before them. As Popper writes, \u201cThe choice was between security and principles on one hand and convenience on the other.\u201d So Jed McCaleb, an iconoclastic math and science prodigy, creates a site called Mt. Gox, where people could buy and sell Bitcoins without having any understanding of the code themselves. After the demands of running it prove too much, McCaleb sells Mt. Gox to a disenfranchised young man named Mark Karpeles, whose inability to deal with real human beings would prove to be his, and perhaps Bitcoin\u2019s, downfall. Popper reports that Karpeles, who sets up shop in Tokyo, was \u201ctwo years into running the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin exchange, but he had still not attended a single Bitcoin event abroad \u2014 a fact that he blamed on the sickness of his cat, Tibanne, who needed daily shots that Mark believed only he could administer.\u201d The meltdown at Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy in 2014, is a story so deliciously weird that it would stand all on its own.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address. Please re-enter.\nYou must select a newsletter to subscribe to.\nView all New York Times newsletters.\nBut Mt. Gox is only one of the strange threads Popper follows through the history of Bitcoin. He also tells its darkest side through Ross Ulbricht, the surfer scientist and libertarian child of hippies, who \u00adcreated Silk Road, where people could engage in illegal transactions under the shroud of anonymity generated by Bitcoin. Silk Road became the Internet\u2019s most infamous illicit bazaar and was the first killer app for Bitcoin. Popper perfectly juxtaposes the tale of federal agents\u2019 old-school efforts to apprehend Ulbricht \u2014 who took the name Dread Pirate \u00adRoberts and justified his most morally reprehensible \u00addecisions in the name of freedom \u2014 with the growing mainstream interest in Bitcoin, from Silicon Valley to New York to the Federal Reserve itself, not as a revolutionary tool but as a practical way to update our currently creaky and pricey methods of moving money. (In May, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison.) In an irony of sorts, the cryptographic technologies at the heart of Bitcoin might themselves have great value as a tool for authenticating previously hard-to-trace transactions.\nAs Bitcoin is adopted by the moneyed class as a better mousetrap for the establishment, it inevitably risks becoming something its original adherents despise. Popper also charts the rise of a stealth company called 21e6, backed by the Valley\u2019s elite, which harnesses technology to create Bitcoins more efficiently than anyone else, thereby mining money for those who already have plenty. The most poignant moment in the book comes when Popper contrasts a conference for the more ideologically minded Bitcoiners at a racetrack on the outskirts of Austin, where Ulbricht grew up, with the gathering of the rich and powerful at the South by Southwest festival, where Ulbricht\u2019s mother is politely dismissed as she pleads for funds to help defray her son\u2019s legal costs. It was an \u201cunhappy reminder of a side of Bitcoin\u201d that its new adherents \u201cwanted to put behind them,\u201d Popper writes. And as he notes, \u201cIf this was the new world, it didn\u2019t seem all that different from the old one \u2014 at least not yet.\u201d\nPopper wants to tell us every last \u00addetail, and while the anecdotes have a you-were-there quality, the book does border on \u00adbecoming encyclopedic at times. I wish he had left some characters out in order to let other stories unspool a little more slowly and pointedly, like when a hacker who manages to track Finney through Bitcoin targets him and his family, demanding ransom as Finney is dying.\nNor can \u201cDigital Gold\u201d be a tale with a satisfying ending, because the future of Bitcoin is unknowable right now. As the venture capitalist Barry Silbert says at a Goldman Sachs conference, Bitcoin \u201cis either going to change everything, or nothing.\u201d But if Bitcoin doesn\u2019t change every\u00adthing, people will keep trying to find something that will, and so Popper\u2019s book stands as necessary reading, and very intriguing at that, regardless of the eventual fate of his subject.\nDIGITAL GOLD\nBitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money\n", "name": "Nathaniel Popper\u2019s \u2018Digital Gold\u2019 Looks at Bitcoin"}, {"text": "The new rules are among the last initiatives Mr. Lawsky will put in place before he leaves government this month to start his own legal and consulting firm.

But he acknowledged that his history left little question that he was among a small group of people who, over decades, working sometimes cooperatively and sometimes in competition, laid the foundation for Bitcoin and created many parts that later went into the virtual currency. Mr. Szabo\u2019s most notable contribution was a Bitcoin predecessor known as bit gold that achieved many of the same goals using similar tools of advanced math and cryptography.\nAdvertisement\nIt may be impossible to prove Satoshi\u2019s identity until the person or people behind Bitcoin\u2019s curtain decide to come forward and prove ownership of Satoshi\u2019s old electronic accounts. At this point, the creator\u2019s identity is no longer important to Bitcoin\u2019s future. Since Satoshi stopped contributing to the project in 2011, most of the open-source code has been rewritten by a group of programmers whose identities are known.\nBut Mr. Szabo\u2019s story provides insight into often misunderstood elements of Bitcoin\u2019s creation. The software was not a bolt out of the blue, as is sometimes assumed, but was instead built on the ideas of multiple people over several decades.\nThis history is more than just a matter of curiosity. The software has come to be viewed in academic and financial circles as a significant computer science breakthrough that may reshape the way money looks and moves. Recently, banks like Goldman Sachs have taken the first steps toward embracing the technology.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Szabo himself has continued to be quietly involved in the work. In the beginning of 2014, Mr. Szabo joined Vaurum, a Bitcoin start-up based in Palo Alto, Calif., that was operating in stealth mode and that aimed to build a better Bitcoin exchange. After his arrival, Mr. Szabo helped reorient the company to take advantage of the Bitcoin software\u2019s capability for so-called smart contracts, which enable self-executing financial transactions, according to people briefed on the company\u2019s operations who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nAdvertisement\nAfter Mr. Szabo led the company in a new direction, it was renamed Mirror, and it recently raised $12.5 million from several prominent venture capitalists, these people said. The company declined to comment for this article.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Szabo\u2019s role at Vaurum has been kept a secret because of his desire for privacy, and he left in late 2014 after becoming nervous about public exposure, according to the people briefed on the company\u2019s operations. While he was still there, though, the array of arcane skills and knowledge at his command led several colleagues to conclude that Mr. Szabo was most likely involved in the creation of Bitcoin, even if he didn\u2019t do it all himself.\nI met Mr. Szabo, a large bearded man, in March 2014 at a Bitcoin event at the Lake Tahoe vacation home of Dan Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs executive who now runs a Bitcoin-focused investment firm, Pantera Capital. Mr. Szabo worked for Vaurum at the time. Mr. Morehead and other hedge fund executives in attendance dressed in expensive loafers and slim-cut jeans; Mr. Szabo, his bald pate encircled by a ring of salt-and-pepper hair, wore beat-up black sneakers and an untucked striped shirt.\nWhile he kept to himself, I managed to corner him in the kitchen during the cocktail hour. He was notably reserved and deflected questions about where he lived and had worked, but he bristled when I cited what was being said about him on the Internet \u2014 including that he was a law professor at George Washington University \u2014 and the notion that he had created Bitcoin.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWell, I will say this, in the hope of setting the record straight,\u201d he said acidly. \u201cI\u2019m not Satoshi, and I\u2019m not a college professor. In fact, I never was a college professor.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe conversation grew less heated when I asked about the origin of the many complicated pieces of code and cryptography that went into the Bitcoin software, and about the small number of people who would have had the expertise to put them together. Mr. Szabo mentioned bit gold, saying it harnessed many of the same obscure concepts, like secure property titles and digital time stamps, that made Bitcoin possible.\n\u201cThere are a whole bunch of parallels,\u201d he told me. \u201cI mean, the reason people tag me is because you can go through secure property titles and bit gold \u2014 there are so many parallels between that and Bitcoin that you can\u2019t find anywhere else.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhen I asked if he believed that Satoshi had been familiar with his work, Mr. Szabo said he understood why there was so much speculation about his own role: \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, there are all these parallels, and it looks funny to me, and looks funny to a lot of other people.\u201d\nDinner began, interrupting the conversation, and I never got another chance to talk to Mr. Szabo.\nWhen I emailed him on Wednesday, he repeated his denial: \u201cAs I\u2019ve stated many times before, all this speculation is flattering, but wrong \u2014 I am not Satoshi.\u201d\nWhile regulators debate the pros and cons of bitcoins, this volatile digital currency inspires the question: What makes money, money?\nMany concepts central to Bitcoin were developed in an online community known as the Cypherpunks, a loosely organized group of digital privacy activists. As part of their mission, they set out to create digital money that would be as anonymous as physical cash. Mr. Szabo was a member, and in 1993, he wrote a message to fellow Cypherpunks describing the diverse motivations of attendees at a group meeting that had just taken place. Some people, he wrote, \u201care libertarians who want government out of our lives, others are liberals fighting the N.S.A., others find it great fun to ding people in power with cool hacks.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMr. Szabo had a libertarian mind-set. He was drawn to those ideas partly, he told me, because of his father, who fought the communists in Hungary in the 1950s before coming to the United States, where Mr. Szabo was born 51 years ago. Reared in Washington State, Mr. Szabo studied computer science at the University of Washington.\nAdvertisement\nSeveral experiments in digital cash circulated on the Cypherpunk lists in the 1990s. Adam Back, a British researcher, created one called hashcash that later became a central component of Bitcoin. Another, called b money, was designed by an intensely private computer engineer named Wei Dai.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address. Please re-enter.\nYou must select a newsletter to subscribe to.\nView all New York Times newsletters.\nWhen these experiments failed to take off, many Cypherpunks lost interest. But not Mr. Szabo. He worked for six months as a consultant for a company called DigiCash, he has written on his blog. In 1998, he sent the outline for his own version of digital money, which he called bit gold, to a small group that was still pursuing the project, including Mr. Dai and Hal Finney, a programmer based in Santa Barbara, Calif., who tried to create a working version of bit gold.\nAdvertisement\nThe concept behind bit gold was very similar to Bitcoin: It included a digital token that was scarce, like gold, and could be sent electronically without needing to pass through a central authority like a bank.\nThis history points to the important role that Mr. Szabo and several others played in developing the building blocks that went into Bitcoin. When Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s paper describing Bitcoin appeared in the fall of 2008, it cited Mr. Back\u2019s hashcash. The first people Satoshi emailed privately were Mr. Back and Mr. Dai, both men have said. And Mr. Finney, who recently died, helped Satoshi improve the Bitcoin software in the fall of 2008, before it was publicly released, according to emails shared with me by Mr. Finney and his family.\nAdvertisement\nIt is, though, Mr. Szabo\u2019s activity in 2008, as Bitcoin emerged into the world, that has generated much of the suspicion about his role in the project. That spring, before anyone had ever heard of Satoshi Nakamoto or Bitcoin, Mr. Szabo revived his bit gold idea on his personal blog, and in an online conversation about creating a live version of the virtual currency, he asked his readers: \u201cAnybody want to help me code one up?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAfter Bitcoin appeared, Mr. Szabo reposted the item on his blog in a way that changed the date at the top and made it appear as though it was written after Bitcoin\u2019s release, archived versions of the website show.\nMr. Szabo\u2019s writing about bit gold from that time contains many striking parallels with Satoshi\u2019s description of Bitcoin, including similar phrasings and even common writing mannerisms. In 2014, researchers at Aston University, in England, compared the writing of several people who have been suspected to be Satoshi and found that none matched up nearly as well as Mr. Szabo\u2019s. The similarity was \u201cuncanny,\u201d said Jack Grieve, the lecturer who led the effort.\nAdvertisement\nWhen I went back and read Mr. Szabo\u2019s online writings, it was obvious that in the year before Satoshi appeared on the scene and released Bitcoin, Mr. Szabo was again thinking seriously about digital money.\nHe wrote frequently, over several months, about the concepts involved in digital money, including those smart contracts, a concept so specialized that Mr. Szabo is often given credit for inventing the term. Smart contracts later showed up as an essential piece of the Bitcoin software.\nMr. Szabo\u2019s blog explained why he was examining these issues with such passion: The global financial crisis then underway suggested to him that the monetary system was broken and in need of replacement.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cFor those who love our once and future freedoms, now is the time to strike,\u201d Mr. Szabo wrote in an item on his blog in late 2007 endorsing the libertarian Ron Paul\u2019s bid for the presidency, in part because of Mr. Paul\u2019s views on the financial system.\nAdvertisement\nFor many Bitcoin watchers, just as notable as what Mr. Szabo wrote in that period was his silence once Bitcoin appeared in October 2008. After all, the virtual currency was an experiment in everything he had been writing about for years. Unlike Mr. Dai, Mr. Finney and Mr. Back, Mr. Szabo has not released any correspondence from Satoshi from this period or acknowledged communicating with him.\nMr. Szabo first made brief mention of Bitcoin on his blog in mid-2009, and in 2011, when the currency was still struggling to gain traction, he wrote about it again at greater length, noting the similarity between bit gold and Bitcoin. He acknowledged that few people would have had the expertise and the instinct to create either of them:\n\u201cMyself, Wei Dai and Hal Finney were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai\u2019s case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai).\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThat item, in May 2011, was one of the last posts Mr. Szabo made before he went on a lengthy hiatus to work, he said later, on a new concept he called temporal programming.\nMay 2011 was also the last time Satoshi communicated privately with other Bitcoin contributors. In an email that month to Martti Malmi, one of the earliest participants, Satoshi wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve moved on to other things and probably won\u2019t be around in the future.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhoever it is, the real Satoshi Nakamoto has many good reasons for wanting to stay anonymous. Perhaps the most obvious is potential danger. Sergio Demian Lerner, an Argentine researcher, has concluded that Satoshi Nakamoto most likely collected nearly a million Bitcoins during the system\u2019s first year. Given that each Bitcoin is now worth about $240, the stash could be worth more than $200 million.

Last week, Goldman became the first bank to make a significant investment in a Bitcoin company when it helped lead a $50 million funding round for the Bitcoin payment company Circle.\nAdvertisement\nMany banks are most interested in the financial network, called the blockchain, that allows the Bitcoin digital tokens to be transferred quickly and cheaply.\nAdvertisement\nThe focus at itBit will be on allowing customers to buy, sell and hold the digital tokens as an asset, like a sort of digital gold.\nWhile regulators debate the pros and cons of bitcoins, this volatile digital currency inspires the question: What makes money, money?\nSince Bitcoin was released in 2009 by a mysterious creator named Satoshi Nakamoto, the largest exchanges have mostly been outside the United States.\nAdvertisement\nMt. Gox, an exchange based in Tokyo, was the dominant exchange for years, but it declared bankruptcy last year and said that nearly $400 million worth of customer coins were either lost or stolen. A criminal investigation is continuing.\nAdvertisement\nMt. Gox was overtaken by Bitstamp, an exchange based in Slovenia. Earlier this year, though, Bitstamp was hacked and lost about $5 million in coins.\nMore recently, a company in San Francisco, Coinbase, said it was opening the first Bitcoin exchange to have all the necessary licenses in the United States. But soon after that announcement, Mr. Lawsky\u2019s office said that Coinbase did not have the licenses needed to operate in New York.\nAdvertisement\n", "name": "Bitcoin Exchange Receives First License in New York State"}, {"text": "The digital currency, which emerged six years ago from the computer of a programmer calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto, is entering a new age, one where its future will be guided mainly by the likes of Goldman Sachs, Wall Street\u2019s premier investment bank, and a growing flock of lawyers.\nAdvertisement\nThis week\u2019s conference nicely illustrated Bitcoin\u2019s efforts to emerge from the shadows. For starters, the panel in question was entitled \u201cBeyond Mt. Gox and Silk Road,\u201d referring to the signature scandals that have largely defined the world of cryptocurrencies in the public\u2019s eye. The former was a Bitcoin exchange that went bust, mainly as a result of incompetence, losing some $450 million. The latter was a dark drug racket that foolishly relied on Bitcoin\u2019s apparent anonymity to cover up its users\u2019 identities.\nSome panels looked at the mechanics behind Bitcoin, but the most widely attended sessions were about regulation. These had titles like \u201cEmerging Issues in Regulatory Compliance and Law Enforcement Efforts,\u201d \u201cBanking MSBs: A Compliance Officer\u2019s Perspective\u201d and \u201cHow to Stop Bitcoin Theft.\u201d If there is to be a grand future for Bitcoin, it will not be as a reserve currency to replace the dollar or yen or as a subfusc network for anarchists, libertarians or mobsters.

Rather than a passive investment, this is a bet made by the Wall Street firm\u2019s principal strategic investments group, a division that puts money to work in start-ups that could disrupt \u2013 or in this case, make more efficient \u2013 the way the bank does business.\nAdvertisement\nAgain, it\u2019s not Bitcoin as a borderless currency or a store of value that\u2019s intriguing to Goldman so much as its underlying technology. Every Bitcoin and all users are encrypted with a unique identity, and each transaction is recorded on a decentralized public ledger, known as a blockchain.\nAdvertisement\nThe Congressional Research Service put it this way in a white paper prepared for United States legislators: This \u201csolves the so-called double spending problem (i.e., spending money you do not own by use of forgery or counterfeiting) and the attendant need for a trusted third party (such as a bank or credit card company) to verify the integrity of electronic transactions.\u201d The application of blockchain technology could be spread across the sorts of activities that Goldman engages in, principally the trading, settling and clearing of securities.\n", "name": "Bitcoin Comes Out of the Shadows and Into Wall Street\u2019s Sights"}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "When Caesar Augustus minted the denarius coin, around 4 A.D., he did so with a decree that it be made almost entirely of silver. But over the coming decades, as the financial health of the Roman Empire declined \u2014 largely because of its increasingly independent army, which demanded ever more money to subdue the rebellious provinces \u2014 the emperors began, slowly at first, mixing in copper to stretch the silver further. By 280 A.D., a denarius was 98 percent copper, with a thin silver wash on the surface. The implication was clear to every Roman: Here, in their hands, was a physical manifestation of the empire\u2019s deepening desperation. Whatever proclamations the emperor might make, the coin told the truth.\nThe lesson, perhaps, is that money shapes \u2014 and is shaped by \u2014 the society at large. And the last century has seen far more transformation in money than any other to date. A hundred years ago, paper money was still just a reference document, the real value hidden away in a vault full of gold. But with the rise of information technology, money has increasingly become an abstraction. We\u2019ve created A.T.M. and debit and credit cards, electronic transfers and 401(k) accounts. Since 1980, computers and deregulation have allowed Wall Street firms to experiment exuberantly with new securities that blur the line between finance and gambling. By the early 2000s, banks were selling securitized mortgage-backed assets as \u201cmoney-good,\u201d and it was largely this mistaking of junk for cash that brought about the financial crisis of 2008.\nThey do their best to hide it, but today the world\u2019s central bankers are in something like a state of panic. Money is, quite clearly, uncontrollable. This manifests in large ways \u2014 like the six years of continuous crisis that have roiled the eurozone \u2014 but also in smaller, more technical matters. For example, the Federal Reserve has no idea how much money is out there, at least in all its digital forms, or how fast the overall supply is growing. This is alarming, because the whole concept behind the Fed is to monitor and control the money supply. That was a much easier task in an era of physical banks and highly regulated savings accounts. But today, each of us has the power to increase the money supply by simply carrying a balance on a credit card. (If you ever meet a central banker and want to get her stammering, ask this question: \u201cHow much money is there, precisely?\u201d)\nOne way to understand this chaos is to see that power is shifting. The authority to create, move and define money \u2014 once confined to central banks and treasury departments \u2014 is being dispersed to an odd mix of entrepreneurs, libertarian hackers and old-line banking institutions. Even for the most technologically skeptical, this monetary chaos isn\u2019t something we can choose to avoid. It\u2019s a new and pivotal force in our economy, and it will change the way we work and live.\nIn this Money Issue, we\u2019ve collected four articles that capture ways that technology is changing the very nature of money. Two of these articles are about Bitcoin and Kickstarter \u2014 two phenomena that represent, in extreme form, two contradictory aspects of money that have been there from the beginning: total anonymity and rich social context. As a digital form of currency, Bitcoin receives its authority not from a government but from an algorithm that is everywhere and nowhere. It allows for an anonymity of exchange and a creation of value all but completely unmoored from history. Kickstarter, by contrast, calls upon money\u2019s other characteristic: its deeply social nature. It\u2019s impossible to make an anonymous donation to Kickstarter, which is precisely the point, since our donations are often performances of sorts, put on for the benefit of friends or people we admire.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

One of them\u00a0profiles a Silicon Valley start-up that claims its technology can ameliorate some of the precariousness of working life \u2014 a precariousness that technology, paradoxically, has helped to create. The other\u00a0documents how a software engine has enabled a profound form of nonfinancial exchange: a \u201ckidney chain,\u201d in which friends and family of patients with kidney failure, potentially as many as 70 in total, donate in an act of reciprocal generosity. It\u2019s a wonderful example of an algorithm, built on the latest computer science, that allows for the most ancient form of exchange \u2014 that is, barter \u2014 to save the lives of loved ones.\nThere is a common perception that economists believe money drives human behavior. In fact, it\u2019s almost precisely the opposite. Most modern economics is predicated on an idea first espoused by David Hume in his 1752 essay, \u201cOf Money,\u201d that currency, gold, bank slips, checks and so on are beside the point. What actually matters is what we make and do and feel and want. Money is just an imperfect tool to add it all up, to assign value to our fundamental human desires. We need money only because it, unlike passion, can be stored and traded and counted.\nArguably the two greatest economists of all time \u2014 Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes \u2014 both wrote about money as a way to get at something far more important: who we human beings really are and how we can have the best possible lives. Smith believed that the core desire of all people was to be both loved and worthy of love. Keynes believed the highest possibility of human life came from creating and appreciating artistic works of true beauty. In either case, money is not some separate force, easily divided from other, more human, concerns. Money is changing now, very fast, but only because we are, too.\n", "name": "In Code We Trust"}, {"text": "A few other Bitcoin companies have recently announced small investments from European banks, and several bank executives have spoken of their interest recently.

New York state\u2019s top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, is completing a BitLicense for virtual currency companies that is expected to be out in late May.\n", "name": "Goldman and IDG Put $50 Million to Work in a Bitcoin Company "}, {"text": "\u201cIf you want it done faster, you pick up the phone and call her yourself,\u201d he growled in Spanish, before switching to another call.\nAdvertisement\nAfter hanging up, he told me in English: \u201cEverybody wants everything now, and I am just trying to do it. I\u2019m not magical, as people think.\u201d\nMagical, no, yet something new all the same. His occupation is one of the world\u2019s oldest, but it remains a conspicuous part of modern life in Argentina: Calle Florida, one of the main streets in downtown Buenos Aires, is crowded day and night with men and women singing out \u201ccambio, cambio, cambio, casa de cambio,\u201d to serve local residents who want to trade volatile pesos for more stable and transportable currencies like the dollar. For Castiglione, however, money-changing means converting pesos and dollars into Bitcoin, a virtual currency, and vice versa.\nThat afternoon, a plump 48-year-old musician was one of several customers to drop by the rented room. A German customer had paid the musician in Bitcoin for some freelance compositions, and the musician needed to turn them into dollars. Castiglione joked about the corruption of Argentine politics as he peeled off five $100 bills, which he was trading for a little more than 1.5 Bitcoins, and gave them to his client. The musician did not hand over anything in return; before showing up, he had transferred the Bitcoins \u2014 in essence, digital tokens that exist only as entries in a digital ledger \u2014 from his Bitcoin address to Castiglione\u2019s. Had the German client instead sent euros to a bank in Argentina, the musician would have been required to fill out a form to receive payment and, as a result of the country\u2019s currency controls, sacrificed roughly 30 percent of his earnings to change his euros into pesos. Bitcoin makes it easier to move money the other way too. The day before, the owner of a small manufacturing company bought $20,000 worth of Bitcoin from Castiglione in order to get his money to the United States, where he needed to pay a vendor, a transaction far easier and less expensive than moving funds through Argentine banks.\nAdvertisement\nThe last client to visit the office that Friday was Alberto Vega, a stout 37-year-old in a neatly cut suit who heads the Argentine offices of the American Bitcoin company BitPay, whose technology enables merchants to accept Bitcoin payments. Like other BitPay employees \u2014 there is a staff of six in Buenos Aires \u2014 Vega receives his entire salary in Bitcoin and lives outside the traditional financial system. He orders what he can from websites that accept Bitcoin and goes to Castiglione when he needs cash. On this occasion, he needed 10,000 pesos to pay a roofer who was working on his house.\nCommerce of this sort has proved useful enough to Argentines that Castiglione has made a living buying and selling Bitcoin for the last year and a half. \u201cWe are trying to give a service,\u201d he said.\nAdvertisement\nThat mundane service \u2014 harnessing Bitcoin\u2019s workaday utility \u2014 is what so excites some investors and entrepreneurs about Argentina. Banks everywhere hold money and move it around; they help make it possible for money to function as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. But thanks in large part to their country\u2019s history of financial instability, a small yet growing number of Argentines are now using Bitcoin instead to fill those roles. They keep the currency in their Bitcoin \u201cwallets,\u201d digital accounts they access with a password, and use its network when they need to send or spend money, because even with Castiglione or one of his competitors serving as middlemen between the traditional economy and the Bitcoin marketplace, Bitcoin can be cheaper and more convenient than Argentina\u2019s financial establishment. In effect, Argentines are conducting an ambitious experiment, one that threatens ultimately to spread to the United States and disrupt some of the most basic services its banks have to offer.\nBitcoin first appeared in early 2009, introduced by a shadowy figure known as Satoshi Nakamoto. The software underlying its creation established that Bitcoins would be released slowly and steadily until there are 21 million of them; at that point, more than 12 decades from now, no more Bitcoins will be generated. These rules produced two somewhat predictable results, especially coming in the immediate wake of the financial crisis and the government bailouts of the big banks. The limited and regular release of Bitcoins appealed to libertarians, who have been skeptical of currencies that governments can print in unlimited quantities. (When Rand Paul announced his candidacy for president last month, his campaign\u2019s website began accepting donations in Bitcoin.) The built-in sense of scarcity also led people to regard Bitcoin as a kind of digital gold, its value likely to increase over time \u2014 in other words, something to buy and sell as a speculative investment. The millions of traders, many of them in China, who have bet on the price of the virtual currency have kept the cumulative value of all outstanding Bitcoins well above $2 billion since late 2013. At the same time, that speculative activity has left much of the general public wondering why these virtual coins should be worth anything at all.\nBut the wild fluctuations in price \u2014 the value of a Bitcoin has bounced between $70 and $1,200 over the last two years \u2014 have obscured a significant aspect of the currency\u2019s broader potential. Bitcoin digital tokens are part of a new kind of online financial network, which runs on the computers of those who use the virtual currency. People who join and support the network \u2014 hosting its open-source software, serving as record-keepers of sorts \u2014 receive new Bitcoins as they are released in a kind of recurring lottery, thus encouraging user participation. The details of how the network operates can be mind-numbingly complicated, involving lots of advanced math and cryptography, but at the most basic level, the network makes it possible for the first time to send valuable digital money around the world almost instantly, without moving through an intermediary like a bank or credit-card company or a service like PayPal. In a sense, the Bitcoin network was designed to be a financial version of email, which enables messages to be delivered without passing through a national postal service, or like the broader Internet itself, which allows people to publish news and essays without going through a media company. Instead of just delivering words, though, the Bitcoin network makes it possible to deliver money from New York to Shanghai in a matter of minutes without paying any financial institution.\nAdvertisement\nThe number of Bitcoin users in Argentina is relatively small; it barely registers on most charts of global Bitcoin usage. But Argentina has been quietly gaining renown in technology circles as the first, and almost only, place where Bitcoins are being regularly used by ordinary people for real commercial transactions. A number of large American companies have started accepting Bitcoin payments, but so far there has been little economic incentive for their customers to pay with Bitcoins.\nAdvertisement\nIn contrast, the best-known Bitcoin start-up in Argentina, BitPagos, is helping more than 200 hotels, both cheap and boutique, take credit-card payments from foreign tourists. The money brought to Argentina using Bitcoin circumvents the onerous government restrictions on receiving money from abroad. Castiglione has some hotel clients, but he says that many of his 800 or so registered customers are freelancers who use Bitcoin to get paid by overseas clients, or companies that want to move money in and out of Argentina. A popular new online retailer, Avalancha, began accepting Bitcoin last summer and has seen the volume of Bitcoin transactions grow steadily since then. Avalancha offers customers a 10 percent discount when they use the virtual currency, because accepting credit cards generally ends up costing Avalancha more than 10 percent as a result of the vagaries of the Argentine financial system. The Bitcoin community in Buenos Aires has been vibrant enough to produce what\u2019s known as the Bitcoin Embassy in the center of the city, a four-story building that serves as the home to eight start-ups whose businesses depends on the Bitcoin network.\nBitcoin proponents like to say that the currency first became popular in the places that needed it least, like Europe and the United States, given how smoothly the currencies and financial services work there. It makes sense that a place like Argentina would be fertile ground for a virtual currency. Inflation is constant: At the end of 2014, for example, the peso was worth 25 percent less than it was at the beginning of the year. And that adversity pales in comparison with past bouts of hyperinflation, defaults on national debts and currency revaluations. Less than half of the population use Argentine banks and credit cards. Even wealthy Argentines fear keeping their money in the country\u2019s banks.\nAdvertisement\nOne particular episode is seared in Casares\u2019s memory. In 1984, during the first significant episode of Argentine hyperinflation following the military junta\u2019s loss of power, Casares\u2019s mother came to get him and his two sisters from school one day. His mother carried two grocery bags filled with cash \u2014 the salary she had just been paid. She rushed with Casares and his sisters to the grocery store and made them run through the aisles, grabbing as much food as they could before the prices changed. (An employee walked through the store all day doing nothing but re-pricing the goods on the shelves to keep up with the rapidly changing value of the peso.) After paying at the register, Casares and his sisters ran back for more food to spend the leftover money on. In this hyperinflationary environment, holding on to pesos was the same thing as losing money.\nAdvertisement\nCasares is descended from one of Argentina\u2019s old landholding families \u2014 a town called Carlos Casares, near Buenos Aires, is named after one of his ancestors \u2014 but his branch of the family went through hard times and ended up ranching sheep. When his father sold wool and the buyer\u2019s check took a month to clear, that income could be halved by inflation, forcing yet more household cutbacks. Whatever savings accumulated were quickly exchanged for dollars, which held their value better than pesos.\nAdvertisement\nIn 2003, Casares and five friends bought a school bus and drove it on a three-week road trip from Buenos Aires, the capital, to Tierra del Fuego, at the southern end of South America. After the vehicle was stolen upon their return, the friends vowed to buy a second bus for another trip. In December 2011, one of them, Jorge Restelli, finally found a bus for 60,000 pesos, or $14,000, in the classified ads. The friends who lived in Argentina quickly paid their shares to purchase and fix it up, but Casares stalled, knowing how much it cost in time and fees to move money from the United States to Argentina. Then Restelli told him that Bitcoin might be just the answer.\nAt the time, the virtual currency had a small cult following in the United States and was essentially unheard-of in Argentina, but Restelli had read about it on an American tech blog. The same day Casares heard about Bitcoin, he found someone online who agreed to meet him at a cafe in Palo Alto and sell him 2,700 or so Bitcoins for about $8,000 in cash. Casares sent Restelli the Bitcoins that evening.\nAdvertisement\nCasares was fascinated by the transaction. Here was money that anyone could buy online and that promised to hold its value better than the peso. (That promise would later be tested by extreme price swings.) It also seemed to offer access to the financial system for those who couldn\u2019t open bank accounts or secure credit cards. Even Casares, who created his first start-up in the country, had never held an Argentine bank account.\nAdvertisement\nHe sent articles about Bitcoin to his bus-trip friends and explained how easy it was to move thousands of dollars in and out of Argentina. One friend went on to found the central Bitcoin advocacy group in Argentina and opened the Bitcoin Embassy in Buenos Aires. Casares began stockpiling Bitcoins, and when he visited Argentina during 2012, he posted offers to sell them on an Internet message board that was becoming a small, impromptu national marketplace for the virtual currency. He organized the first Bitcoin Meetup in Argentina in December 2012, though only a handful of people besides Restelli showed up at the whiskey bar where it was held.\nBy then, Casares was proclaiming Bitcoin\u2019s promise to any Silicon Valley friend who would listen. He had come to believe that the advantages of its network would push the value of each Bitcoin to astronomical values, just as slivers of the airwave spectrum increased in worth as more communication companies sought to use it. In the meantime, each Bitcoin could serve as an easy, secure place to store money, comparable to gold.\nThe buzz generated by the conference was not the only factor that pushed up the price of Bitcoin in March 2013. A financial crisis in Cyprus came to a head in the middle of the month; the closure of some bank accounts there led to conjecture that Russians were seeking refuge from the Cypriot banking system in Bitcoin. But Casares noticed that every time he helped another one of his wealthy friends start buying Bitcoins, prices rose, suggesting to him that they were responsible for much of the increase. Over the course of March, the price of a single Bitcoin nearly tripled, to around $100, and that surge generated the first widespread media coverage in the United States and Argentina (some of it, not coincidentally, from journalists cultivated by Casares). The crowd at the next Bitcoin Meetup in Argentina, hosted in April by one of Casares\u2019s friends, was about five times larger than the first one organized by Casares just a few months earlier.\nAdvertisement\nDante Castiglione first heard about Bitcoin that same March. A Canadian who hired him to do some software consulting asked if he could pay him in Bitcoin. Castiglione, who grew up in a small apartment in downtown Buenos Aires, ran his own consulting firm, the latest in a long line of jobs after he dropped out of college. He is a successful version of what Argentines refer to as a buscavida, a person who gets by finding opportunities on the fringes of society, a more expansive career option in Argentina than in most countries.\nWhen it came to working for overseas clients, the biggest issue for Castiglione, like many Argentines, was the government-set exchange rate between dollars and pesos. In an attempt to tamp down inflation, the government has long forced banks to sell dollars at artificially low rates. In March 2013, the government said a dollar was worth around 5 pesos. But anyone could go to one of the money changers on Calle Florida and trade a dollar bill for about 8 pesos, the black-market rate, also known as the d\u00f3lar blue. (Economists and people outside Argentina often regard the d\u00f3lar blue as the real exchange rate, a closer reflection of the peso\u2019s actual worth.) The official exchange rate was costly for businessmen like Castiglione. When dollars from foreign customers came in through traditional means, banks automatically converted them at the mandated rate, and Castiglione ended up with three fewer pesos for each dollar than he would have gotten by exchanging them on the street. Castiglione had to sacrifice nearly 40 percent of a foreign payment to turn it into pesos.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

The demand for his Bitcoins was, in fact, so great that Castiglione, whose company was limping along, began to think there might be a business opportunity there. If he bought Bitcoins for slightly less than he sold them, he could make a profit on every trade, even if the price of Bitcoin didn\u2019t go up. By September 2013, he had become a full-time Bitcoin broker.\nAdvertisement\nIn-person Bitcoin trading, as Castiglione does it, happens in many other cities around the world. But if this were the only way to procure Bitcoins, the interest in trading them would not have exploded as it has in the United States and China, where exchanging money directly with strangers \u2014 without a trusted middleman, in other words \u2014 is not a routine part of business. In most places where Bitcoin has become popular, there have been ways to buy the virtual currency online. This, of course, requires cooperation with banks or other payment networks, which happened in the United States and Europe. The American company Coinbase, for instance, allows customers to transfer money from their bank to a Coinbase account and buy Bitcoins online.\nIn Argentina, the banks refuse to work with Bitcoin companies like Coinbase, which isn\u2019t surprising, given the government\u2019s tight control over banks. This hasn\u2019t deterred Argentines, long accustomed to changing money outside official channels. For Castiglione and his company, DigiCoins, this means operating at the edge of the law, but he takes comfort from the fact that, at least for now, the Argentine government has bigger problems to deal with.\nAdvertisement\nInstead of bank tellers and branches, Bitcoin users in Argentina have come to rely on Castiglione and his competitors, some of whom are even willing to make house calls. This financial system developed much more slowly than it has in the United States, where American companies could take deposits from banks anywhere in the country. But as a result, Argentina\u2019s Bitcoin economy is much more resistant to bank policies, government regulations and full-service companies like Coinbase that undermine Bitcoin\u2019s decentralizing spirit.\nI first met Castiglione when I visited Buenos Aires in June 2014. At the time, he was working downtown, out of a stuffy single room in the same building as a Berlitz language-school office. A joker playing card was lodged in the corner of the whiteboard on the wall. A friend of Castiglione\u2019s son was at a desk, working on the DigiCoins website. His daughter, Fiona, was in touch with customers by phone and online. His son, Marco, was in and out, taking cash to clients, which he carried in his backpack. Sitting behind his own desk next to the door, Castiglione was describing the life of a money-changer, especially when it comes to matters of security. He spoke with tough confidence: \u201cNot many people will like to mess with us.\u201d\nBut he acknowledged that he and his children remained safe largely because they successfully kept their clients ignorant of their location by switching offices frequently: \u201cRight now, maybe God is on our side.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nOne of Castiglione\u2019s main competitors was another Bitcoin broker named Brenda Fern\u00e1ndez. Originally from the Buenos Aires suburbs and a college dropout, she previously smuggled electronics into the country and sold them on the local equivalent of eBay. She talked in loud bursts, punctuated with high-pitched laughs, and proudly made provocative statements about breaking the law and ignoring standard business practices when I met her at an event at the Bitcoin Embassy. \u201cI find a way to market myself as the crazy Bitcoin girl,\u201d she told me.\nIn a more serious moment, Fern\u00e1ndez, who is 24, attributed both her attitude and her embrace of Bitcoin in part to the gender transition she made in her early 20s, after years of struggling with traditional gender categories. \u201cIt feels good, doing things that you are not supposed to, saying to the structures of power that they don\u2019t have power over you,\u201d she said.\nAdvertisement\nAfter the event at the embassy, Fern\u00e1ndez took a small black-and-yellow taxi to a hostel near the National Congress that wanted to exchange about $1,000 worth of Bitcoins. The Rock Hostel, with band-themed rooms, caters to a young clientele. A number of people were drinking beer in the common area when Fern\u00e1ndez showed up. The owner, a tattooed 29-year-old named Soledad Rodriguez Pons, had already transferred the Bitcoins to Fern\u00e1ndez online, so after a bit of flirting, Fern\u00e1ndez quickly handed over the cash; the transaction took place at the reception desk, where a sign offered customers a 10 percent discount if they paid by credit card. On top of the desk, under glass, were paper currencies from around the world.\nAdvertisement\nThe Rock Hostel is one of hundreds of hotels in the country using the Argentine start-up BitPagos to collect credit-card payments from foreign customers. If Rodriguez Pons accepted credit-card payments from American customers through the usual financial channels, customers would be billed in dollars, and when those dollars came to Rodriguez Pons\u2019s Argentine bank account, they would be converted at the official rate, about 30 percent lower than the black-market rate. It would also take 20 days for Rodriguez Pons to get her pesos. BitPagos helped counter these drawbacks by taking the credit-card payment in the United States and then using the dollars to buy Bitcoins, generally from Coinbase, before sending them to Rodriguez Pons immediately. When Rodriguez Pons needed to pay the rent or laundry bills, she called Fern\u00e1ndez or Castiglione \u2014 her two standbys \u2014 to sell the Bitcoins for pesos at a rate close to the d\u00f3lar blue. Rodriguez Pons saved so much money this way that she could offer the 10 percent discount for credit cards and still easily come out ahead. In June 2014, BitPagos moved about $150,000 for the Rock Hostel and other tourist establishments, nearly twice what it handled three months earlier.\nRodriguez Pons, like many BitPagos clients, knew little about how Bitcoin worked and hadn\u2019t tried hard to figure it out. She once, somewhat accidentally, held onto her Bitcoins at a time when the price was rising, and ended up with a small windfall when she sold. She used the proceeds to build a rooftop bar and a music-rehearsal space. Beyond those extras, Rodriguez Pons credited the savings from using BitPagos with keeping her business alive in Argentina\u2019s very difficult business environment. The hardest part was often reaching Fern\u00e1ndez and Castiglione.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI had to call Brenda four times today,\u201d she said with a smile.\nAs anyone who has dealt with Western Union or wired money abroad already knows, Argentina is not the only place that could benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s easier and cheaper way of moving money across international borders. A Hong Kong firm called Bitspark recently opened a shop in a mall popular with Filipino domestic workers, through which they can send money back home using Bitcoin. Another firm, BitPesa, allows customers to convert Bitcoins into Kenyan shillings and deliver them into mobile wallets within Kenya.\nTransactions of this sort inevitably stir up fears of money laundering and terrorist financing. Banks currently serve as the front line in stopping illicit money transfers. If these regulated institutions are cut out of the business of moving money, the banks and government officials say, who will ensure that terrorists and organized crime are not using the network to move millions across borders? The fact that there is no single authority responsible for supervising the Bitcoin system has also made it easier for con men and thieves to defraud companies holding Bitcoins for customers \u2014 something that became clear last year when Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, declared bankruptcy after nearly half a billion dollars of clients\u2019 Bitcoins were fraudulently transferred out of their accounts. (A hacker generally needs only an owner\u2019s password to steal his or her Bitcoins.)\nAdvertisement\nOddly enough, American regulators have actually been friendlier than banks toward the new technology. Even before the advent of Bitcoin, the Federal Reserve was looking into ways to update the relatively antiquated American payment networks, which often take two or three days to complete a simple money transfer. Several different branches of the Federal Reserve have released research papers over the last few years praising the improvements that Bitcoin might spur, even if Bitcoin itself isn\u2019t adopted by the mainstream as a virtual currency. In 2013, when he was chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke wrote a letter to a Senate committee studying Bitcoin in which he praised its \u201clong-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.\u201d\nOne of the most recent entrants into this area is a start-up led by a former top executive from JPMorgan. The Federal Reserve has had its own people looking at how to utilize the blockchain technology and potentially even Bitcoin itself. If someone can find a way to minimize the volatility of Bitcoin prices \u2014 as many are trying to do \u2014 it would be much easier for people to keep their savings in Bitcoin instead of a bank account.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIn the long run, Bitcoin will be very disruptive to the developed world,\u201d Dan Morehead, a former Goldman Sachs executive who now runs a hedge fund focused on Bitcoin, told me. Things are happening sooner in Argentina, he said, because its financial system creates hassles for the people there. But, he added, \u201cArgentina is just a more extreme example of the situation in every country.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWhen I returned to Argentina in February this year, the price of Bitcoin had been falling for some time, scaring off many speculators in the United States. There was no sign of waning interest in Argentina, however. Several new companies were trying to provide a more seamless and reliable version of Castiglione\u2019s service. BitPagos had recently started a service allowing its users to buy and sell small quantities of Bitcoin online and was closing in on a million-dollar fund-raising round with Silicon Valley venture capitalists, including Dan Morehead\u2019s firm. A new company, Bitex, which had its own office down the street from the Bitcoin Embassy, was focused on using Bitcoin to transfer money among Latin American countries. All of the Argentine Bitcoin companies were working on expanding into Venezuela, where inflation is an even greater problem.\nAdvertisement\nCastiglione was so busy running around the city, trying to keep up with the competition, that he was hard to pin down. When we finally met near the Bitcoin Embassy, late at night, he was with a tough-looking friend who was joining DigiCoins to help with the physical deliveries of cash, bringing with him a motorcycle and experience handling large amounts of money. The men had just come back from a trip to a town three hours west of Buenos Aires, where they had sold $20,000 worth of Bitcoins. They had been forced to make the trip at the last minute because another big sale had fallen through, and they did not otherwise have enough dollars to conduct business for the next few days. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gotten that cash, I was done,\u201d Castiglione told me, before heading out for a last trade just before midnight.\nEarlier that day, as I sat with Fern\u00e1ndez in a Subway sandwich shop, which was her temporary office, chosen for its free Wi-Fi, she did not try to hide her difficulty in adapting to the more competitive environment with her \u201ccrazy Bitcoin girl\u201d routine, which was making it hard to keep big customers. She did have one business in the United States that sent her about $5,000 worth of Bitcoins each month and had her exchange the money and deposit the pesos into the company\u2019s Argentine bank account, in order to make payroll. But a lot of her customers were young people who wanted to buy a few hundred pesos worth of a Bitcoin so that they could pay online for a Netflix subscription or a video game. \u201cThe market moved in another direction,\u201d she said, \u201cand I didn\u2019t move in that direction.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nShe had come to have serious doubts about whether Bitcoin would end up being any better than the old system if it was dominated by the ruling class, which would be immune to any popular backlash, thanks to the lack of a central Bitcoin authority. \u201cThe key turning point is when the rich elite see it as a way to safeguard their wealth,\u201d she said.\nAmong the people Fern\u00e1ndez and Castiglione were both contending with was Wences Casares. He decided in late 2013 that he cared too much about Bitcoin to leave its development to others. He quickly sold his digital-wallet start-up and started his own Bitcoin-centric company with one of the friends from the bus trip, Federico Murrone, an Argentine who was the head programmer on Casares\u2019s past start-ups. Within two months of selling their old company, Casares and Murrone had secured $40 million in funding from investors like Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn co-founder.\nThe office that Casares\u2019s new company, Xapo (pronounced \u201czappo\u201d), opened in Buenos Aires has none of the scrappiness of other virtual-currency players in the country. It occupies a full floor of a building in a fashionable part of the city; amenities included table tennis, glass walls and large, wall-mounted televisions. Xapo initially concentrated on ultrasecure storage for customers who own lots of Bitcoins \u2014 it holds the Bitcoins of many of the wealthy tech moguls who followed Casares\u2019s advice. But Casares has ambitions to turn the company into a one-stop financial provider for the virtual-currency industry. The global aspirations were evident from the Hindi-language site that I saw his staff creating.\nAdvertisement\nCasares spent months establishing a partnership with Taringa, the most popular Argentine social network. This month, millions of Taringa members in Argentina and the rest of Latin America automatically had a Xapo Bitcoin wallet opened for them. Users will be able to put Bitcoins or fractions of Bitcoins in their wallets by depositing cash at local drugstores, in the same way they pay utility bills. From those accounts, Argentines can pay for things online without a credit card or make online micropayments of 5 or 10 cents for video games and other digital goods (credit cards usually charge a minimum of 25 or 30 cents for each purchase).\nWhen I asked Castiglione what he thought about a global venture like Xapo, he evinced a workingman\u2019s skepticism. \u201cWe might not be as big as Wences, but the real thing happens here,\u201d Castiglione said, as we sat in his temporary office between client visits. \u201cPeople get the cash to spend.\u201d\nWhether his endeavors would help Bitcoin live up to its grand promise \u2014 supplanting Wall Street and central banks \u2014 was something Castiglione would consider only in the most pragmatic terms.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t use it, it will go to trash, like anything that isn\u2019t used in this world,\u201d he told me. \u201cIf people use it, then it has a future.\u201d\n", "name": "Can Bitcoin Conquer Argentina?"}, {"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Presidential fund-raising, never known for its transparency, may have just become even more secretive.\nFederal law bans contributions to individual candidates from foreigners, corporations or straw donors, among other restrictions, and campaigns are expected to make their \u201cbest efforts\u201d to collect and publicly identify donors who contribute more than $200 in a year and to detect contributions that may be illegal.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAt some level, we are trusting candidates,\u201d said Richard L. Hasen, a campaign finance expert at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law. The system already relies on some measure of trust from candidates, he said, \u201cbut the difference with Bitcoin is that it is inherently untraceable.\u201d\nIn a ruling last year, the Federal Election Commission agreed to allow a political action committee to accept Bitcoins with a voluntary limit of $100, but the commissioners split over how the online currency \u2014 which can fluctuate widely in value \u2014 should be treated on a broader scale or whether it should be capped.\nWhile regulators debate the pros and cons of bitcoins, this volatile digital currency inspires the question: What makes money, money?\n\u201cBitcoins are no more anonymous than any other contribution,\u201d wrote Lee E.

Ravel, Steven T. Walther and Ellen L. Weintraub \u2014 were much more cautious in endorsing the limited use of Bitcoins.\nAdvertisement\nBitcoins should be treated the same as cash, with a cap of $100, to protect against unethical and illegal activities, the three commissioners wrote. \u201cThe fact that Bitcoins are ultimately untraceable makes prophylactic measures at the outset of the transaction particularly important,\u201d they said. The commission did not adopt the cap.\nFor Mr. Paul, who has been sharply critical of the government\u2019s electronic surveillance programs as an attack on privacy, his embrace of Bitcoins \u2014 with their added layers of privacy \u2014 is a way to establish his bona fides with younger voters who put a premium on Internet freedom and technology.\n\n                Donald J.

The block chain, they say, could ultimately upend not only the traditional financial system but also the way people transfer and record financial assets like stocks, contracts, property titles, patents and marriage licenses \u2014 essentially anything that requires a trusted middleman for verification.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThere\u2019s a race going on to extend the block chain\u2019s capabilities,\u201d said Adam Ludwin, a co-founder of Chain.com, a start-up that seeks to help developers build Bitcoin applications.\nAdvertisement\nOn web forums and at Bitcoin conferences, talk is shifting to the next generation of applications built on block-chain technology. So-called Bitcoin 2.0 projects dominated the conversation at the Satoshi Roundtable, a retreat for Bitcoin enthusiasts at a resort in the Dominican Republic in February, according to accounts from some participants. About 20 percent of Chain\u2019s roughly 5,000 users are developing nonfinancial block-chain applications, compared with less than 10 percent a year ago, Mr. Ludwin said. Banks and multinational telecommunications companies are quietly expressing interest in ways to take advantage of the block chain.\nAdvertisement\nInvestors are also starting to bet on the technology. Through the end of February, Bitcoin companies had raised $550 million in venture capital, according to Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm. And although much of that financing has been directed to trading platforms, exchanges and digital-wallet start-ups \u2014 $106 million alone has gone to Coinbase, a popular provider of Bitcoin wallets \u2014 companies working on block-chain applications are beginning to secure chunks of financing.\nFor instance, Blockstream \u2014 which is looking to extend the block chain\u2019s capabilities \u2014 announced it had raised $21 million in November. Ripple Labs, which oversees an online payment system called Ripple, has raised $9 million and is finalizing another round of financing.\nAmong the venture capital firms that have backed Bitcoin-related companies is Khosla Ventures, an investor in Blockstream and Chain. Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla, said the firm\u2019s investments were based on the conviction that the block chain would alter the way society thought about transactions \u2014 financial or otherwise.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAnytime there\u2019s a broker \u2014 anytime there\u2019s an expert attesting to the validity of something \u2014 all of that could be obviated by the block chain,\u201d Mr. Rabois said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a guaranteed success, but the upside is so large that as a venture investor, it\u2019s an extremely attractive investment opportunity.\u201d\nWhile regulators debate the pros and cons of bitcoins, this volatile digital currency inspires the question: What makes money, money?\nSeveral start-ups are developing ways to transfer traditional money using the block chain in the hopes of streamlining financial transactions. One such company, Coins.ph, based in the Philippines, has seized on the block chain\u2019s peer-to-peer technology as a way to improve the remittance business and global payments by lowering costs and speeding up transactions. The company\u2019s goal is for people to use its services without having to understand the block chain, much as people send email without thinking about the Internet.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe way I think of the block chain is a really modern infrastructure to move money around the globe,\u201d said Marwan Forzley, the chief executive of Align Commerce, another start-up seeking to make cross-border payments easier.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough companies focused on financial applications for the block chain far outnumber those experimenting with other uses, the gap is narrowing. For example, a start-up called BlockSign verifies signed documents on the block chain. Another company, Filecoin, is aiming to build a marketplace for storing data on the block chain.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

The company is also toying with registry applications for other records, including title deeds and financial data.\n\u201cOur entire system of contracts is based on a trusted third party,\u201d said Naveed Sherwani, the chief executive of PeerNova. But with the block chain, he added, \u201cthere is no third party anymore.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWith the rise of the block chain has come a fundamental question: Should technology replace human discretion? Some experts, even those who study cryptocurrency, are skeptical.\n\u201cThere are very good reasons why we have legal and social institutions and economic intermediaries,\u201d said Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton who studies block-chain technology.\nAdvertisement\nIn his teaching, Professor Narayanan said he often used car ownership as an example. In theory, block-chain technology could eliminate the need for, among other inconveniences, title certificates and dealers to ensure the secure transfer of money and property. The idea initially sounds appealing, but if the car is broken into or stolen, he said, the block chain alone will not be able to resolve the dispute.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just one human you\u2019re getting rid of, but the entire economic, legal and social structure that reinforces the idea of property,\u201d he said.\nThere is also still broad support for Bitcoin. Many investors and entrepreneurs maintain that Bitcoin will outgrow its early role as a speculative investment and become a viable alternative currency for international payments. Others see countries turning to Bitcoin when their own currency is unstable.\nAdvertisement\nThe virtual currency must also maintain some value for the network to work. Bitcoin miners, the computers that drive the block chain, win Bitcoins if they successfully solve complex cryptographic problems. If Bitcoin\u2019s value continues to drop, it could become too expensive to keep the computers running.\nAdvertisement\nBut there are also those wary of moving too fast. Though enthusiastic about the block chain\u2019s potential, a group of Bitcoin supporters, many of them early adopters, wants start-ups to focus first on strengthening existing Bitcoin applications, like digital wallets and trading platforms, before developing other uses for the underlying technology.\nExchanges, where traders can meet to buy and sell Bitcoins for dollars, euros and other currencies, have been especially vulnerable. Anxiety from the collapse last year of Mt. Gox, a prominent exchange based in Japan, is still high.

After that, her decryption key would be destroyed and any chance of accessing the 5,726 files on her PC \u2014 all of her data \u2014 would be lost forever.\nSincerely, CryptoWall.\nFinally, can law enforcement at least do something to stop these attacks in the future? Probably not. Many ransomware viruses originate in Russia and other former Soviet bloc countries. The main difficulty in stopping cybercriminals isn\u2019t finding them, but getting foreign governments to cooperate and extradite them.\nBy the time my mom called to ask for my help, it was already Day 6 and the clock was ticking. (Literally \u2014 the virus comes with a countdown clock, ratcheting up the pressure to pay.) My father had already spent all week trying to convince her that losing six months of files wasn\u2019t the end of the world (she had last backed up her computer in May). It was pointless to argue with her. She had thought through all of her options; she wanted to pay.\nOnly, paying turned out not to be so easy; the CryptoWall hackers take only Bitcoins.\nPicture the kind of early-adopting, hoodie-wearing member of the technocracy totally comfy with the idea of a cybercurrency neither backed nor issued by any central bank or government. Now picture the opposite of that. That is my mom. Having never so much as purchased an app in her life, my mom had no idea how to buy Bitcoins. Happily, her ransomers had anticipated this problem and included a link to a step-by-step guide, complete with pictures.\nShe\u2019d managed to make a cash deposit via Bank of America to the unique Bitcoin \u201cwallet\u201d provided by her ransomers, but since Bitcoin\u2019s price is extremely volatile, her payment had already fallen $25 short by the time it arrived. (Credit and debit payments can take up to six days to process.) The fastest way to send the extra $25 was to make a direct deposit at an A.T.M. that handled Bitcoin transactions. That\u2019s where I came in. Coin Cafe, the Bitcoin provider my mother had chosen, had an A.T.M. in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, not too far from where I lived.\nAdvertisement\nThe Bitcoin A.T.M. was not easy to find. It was housed in the second floor hallway of a cooperative work space, tucked inside an old Nynex phone booth. On one hand, I appreciated the winking irony of this sight gag. On the other hand, Fidelity Investments this was not.\nAdvertisement\nInside was a little white box with no buttons, just a screen, a camera eye and a money slot. I scanned in the QR code my mom had sent me. The machine whirred to life. \u201cBalance query in progress,\u201d it announced. This query remained in progress for the next 20 minutes during which I left three messages on Coin Cafe\u2019s voice mail before abandoning the booth to get some coffee and walk around in the rain.\nAdvertisement\nThe fourth time I called, a human being answered the phone and told me the problem had been fixed. I hurried back to the A.T.M., scanned in my QR code, sent some Voldemorts $25 in crisp bills and called my mom. The whole experience had not done much to allay my misgivings about Bitcoin; what did allay them was Mike Hoats, the nice bearded man Coin Cafe sent over to fix the A.T.M.\nWe got to talking after I made my payment, and he told me that, while no one at Coin Cafe believed people should fund criminal activity by paying the ransom, their job was to broker the purchase and sale of Bitcoins, which, like cash, could be used for any purpose. CryptoWall had thrust them into the unwitting role of ransomware advisers, coping with grandmothers crying on the phone at the thought of losing all their photos or small-business owners whose family income was on the line. Coin Cafe didn\u2019t like profiting from the victims (according to the company, these transactions are in the low single digits as a percentage of its total business), but they were downright mortified to learn that CryptoWall had anointed them as one of their Bitcoin providers of choice, with praise for their \u201cfast, simple service.\u201d That\u2019s how my mom found out about Coin Cafe \u2014 from her ransom note.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Twenty percent off when you refer this malware to a friend? Frequent virus cards? Black Friday ransom specials?\n\u201cI THINK they like the idea they don\u2019t have to pretend they\u2019re not criminals,\u201d Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at the computer security firm Sophos, told me when I reached him in Vancouver by phone. \u201cBy using the fact that they\u2019re criminals to scare you, it\u2019s just a lot easier on them.\u201d They don\u2019t have to hire a professional translator to get their English perfect, Mr. Wisniewski explained, or engage in any of the baroque subterfuge required of someone pretending to be a Nigerian gentleman farmer who just needs a little help claiming his inheritance.\nIn addition to being criminals, these peddlers of ransomware are clearly businesspeople, skillfully appropriating all the tools of e-commerce. From branding (CryptoWall is a variant of a fearsome earlier virus called CryptoLocker, which was shut down last year) to determining what they can extort (ransomware hackers have tested the market with prices as low as $100 and as high as $800,000, which the city of Detroit refused to pay in order to have its database decrypted), these operators are, as Mr. Wisniewski put it, part of \u201ca very mature, well-oiled capitalist machine.\u201d It\u2019s also an incredibly lucrative machine: Some experts estimate that CryptoLocker hackers cleared around $30 million in 100 days in 2013. And more than a million PCs worldwide have been hit with the CryptoWall virus.\nAdvertisement\nEven after reading through numerous descriptions of CryptoWall 2.0 as \u201cthe largest and most destructive ransomware threat on the Internet\u201d and \u201can enormous danger for computer users,\u201d I still couldn\u2019t help thinking this was mainly a problem for moms who persist in using big, boxy PC computers and small-town police departments. Mr. Wisniewski quickly disabused me of that notion. Although CryptoWall has primarily affected Windows computers and Android cellphones so far, there is no technological barrier that prevents the virus from infiltrating Macs like mine. And when it does, Mr. Wisniewski chuckled, I should expect the ransom to be a lot higher.\nSo what can we all do to protect ourselves? Keep our computers backed up on an independent drive or by using a cloud backup service like Carbonite, take those software update and \u201cpatch\u201d alerts seriously and, most of all, Beware the Attachment. (Remember: Brand-name businesses like J. Crew or Bank of America will rarely send you an attachment.)\nAdvertisement\nOf course, this advice arrives too late for my mom. And it appeared her payment had arrived too late as well: By the time I got home from Greenpoint, her CryptoWall ransom had been raised to $1,000, and the $500 in Bitcoins she had deposited had vanished. In a panic, she wrote to Mike Hoats asking for advice. What he told her sounded crazy to me. Use the CryptoWall message interface to tell the criminals exactly what happened. Be honest, in other words.\nAdvertisement\nSo she did. She explained that the virus had struck the same week that a major snowstorm hit Massachusetts and the Thanksgiving holiday shut down the banks. She told them about the unexpected Bitcoin shortfall and about dispatching her daughter to the Coin Cafe A.T.M. at the 11th hour. She swore she had really, really tried not to miss their deadline. And then a weird thing happened: Her decryption key arrived.\nAdvertisement\nWhen I shared the news with Mr. Hoats, he was jubilant. \u201cThat is great news, truly!\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhoever these yahoos are, they have some little shred of humanity.\u201d\n", "name": "How My Mom Got Hacked "}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "But that distinction is eroding: After all, the value of a currency lies in what you can buy with it, not in the fact that a government says it\u2019s worth something.

When I buy something with Widgetcash, it doesn\u2019t go through any bank.\nAdvertisement\nThat\u2019s why a digital wallet, loaded with your dollars, credit and loyalty points, is such a revolutionary technology \u2014 it makes those transfers and transactions seamless and safe.\nImagine you want to buy a shirt at Target. Your digital wallet can pay for it with dollars, your Target points or any other form of purchasing power that Target accepts.

Frictionless exchange is a killer app. Some companies might lose value in their loyalty programs, but others will find enormous value in issuing their own currencies for advertising or data-tracking purposes, or even just because the creation of a successful virtual currency or digital wallet lets companies make money by making money.

The wallet system searches its clients and finds someone \u2014 call her Hannah \u2014 with enough M.B.B.P.s for the transaction. It buys the audiobook with her points and sends it to you, and sends Hannah dollars from your account.\nAdvertisement\nFollowing Bitcoin\u2019s protocol, the wallet software broadcasts these transactions to the network, and every wallet in the world updates the M.B.B.P.-to-dollar exchange rate.\nAdvertisement\nThe idea is that you can buy anything, with anything. The wallet will find the best deal and execute it. In so doing, it will ignore the historical and cultural differences between dollars, points, coins and virtual property. It\u2019s all bits anyway.\nThis sort of digital wallet raises difficult problems for regulators, who rely on institutional intermediaries like banks as the point for monitoring transactions. But a digital wallet can be a phone app; just like the cash in your pocket, it doesn\u2019t require accounts with any intermediary. A wallet app can be written by anyone, downloaded by anyone and secured and maintained by everyone. In this huge river of money, there is no narrow channel from which the state can divert flow into its own fields.\nConsider the tax implications. If you get caught cheating on your taxes and flee the country, the government could compel your bank to freeze your assets and cough up the money. But what if there\u2019s no bank?\nOne concern that doesn\u2019t apply is transparency. Digital wallets don\u2019t hide trades or encourage criminal transactions. Using Bitcoin is much less secret than using hard cash. The government, and anybody else, can easily see the trades passing through our wallets, just as every trade in Bitcoin is visible at blockchain.info. Even if you try to hide who you are, network or traffic analysis can often de-anonymize you. The critical point is that, with a digital wallet, a government or bank can see the trades, but it will be harder to compel or block them.\n", "name": "The Digital Wallet Revolution"}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "Mr. Finney wrote in 1992 that cryptographic technology appealed to him because he worried about the ability of corporations and governments to snoop on citizens.\n\u201cThe work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete,\u201d he wrote to an online group of fellow privacy activists.\nThe original author of P.G.P., Philip R.

Hunter, one of the Republican commissioners, told the lawyer for a left-leaning digital media firm that his client need not worry if the commission declined to bless its proposed approach to disclosure.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt looks like this is going to go down 3 to 3,\u201d Ms. Hunter said. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s not four votes to say, \u2018You can\u2019t do this.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nUnder federal law, no more than three members of the commission may belong to the same political party. Four votes are required to issue an advisory opinion, pursue an investigation or agree on a punishment. Veterans of the commission say that for many years the arrangement was effective in encouraging commissioners to apply rules consistently to both parties.\nAdvertisement\nBut deadlocks have become far more common since 2008, when three new Republican commissioners joined the commission.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to a study by Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the liberal-leaning group Public Citizen, the commission has not only taken up far fewer advisory requests and issued fewer regulations than it did before 2008, it has also split votes on a greater proportion of the matters it does consider.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

In the five subsequent years, it held just 866 enforcement votes, and split votes on 123 of them.\n\u201cThe Republicans on the commission realized they can render the commission toothless,\u201d said Mr. Holman, whose organization favors tougher disclosure rules and is suing the commission for what it says is a failure to enforce existing disclosure rules against Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, a leading Republican outside group.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Goodman acknowledged that candidates and outside groups were operating in a less restrictive regulatory environment than five years ago. But he argued that the shift reflected deregulatory court rulings, such as Citizens United, and a proper restraint in applying limits on political speech.\n\u201cCertainly the Republicans have become far more circumspect in where we draw the lines,\u201d Mr. Goodman said.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Goodman also said that the percentage of deadlocks had dropped over the past year and represented only a small percentage of total votes by the commission. \u201cOur opinion is as legitimate as their opinion,\u201d he said, referring to the three commissioners appointed by Democrats. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t four votes to support a regulatory position, it\u2019s not the position of the F.E.C.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe deadlocks appear to have had a particular impact on enforcement cases. In a series of deadlocks over proposed fines or settlements, Republican commissioners have in effect created a new, higher standard for investigations, arguing that direct evidence of a violation must already exist before the commission staff can even begin investigating a complaint.\n\u201cIt is not enough for the commission to believe that there is a reason to investigate whether a violation occurred,\u201d the three Republican commissioners wrote in an opinion last year blocking an investigation into officials of the Arizona Democratic Party.\nAdvertisement\nA commission deadlock on a complaint can be challenged in court, but under court rulings dating to the early 1990s, federal judges in such cases have deferred to the legal interpretation of the three commissioners voting to block an investigation.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe fact that there is this deference given to what is an obstacle to disclosure ultimately means that there is no meaningful judicial remedy when the F.E.C. does not come to a decision,\u201d said Ann M. Ravel, a Democrat who joined the commission last year.\nEven apparent agreements among the commissioners can be illusory.

Bitcoin, a virtual currency that is meant to allow smooth financial transactions across borders without government involvement, has a zealous group of devoted technologists, speculators and libertarian ideologues. It has also recently made headlines in several areas \u2014 for its big-name investors like the Winklevoss twins, and, most recently, the spectacular bankruptcy filing of a trading exchange, Mt. Gox, with more than $450 million worth of coins reported to have gone missing.\nAdvertisement\nAnd as Bitcoin has gone from a fringe digital experiment to a mainstream digital experiment, the search for its secretive creator, or creators, has become something of a holy grail. There are few leads to go on \u2014 other than the name, \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto,\u201d similar to Mr. Nakamoto\u2019s own name, and some writings online, including a white paper from 2008. Still, publications like The New Yorker, Fast Company and Vice have spent significant reporting time trying to reveal the Bitcoin inventor\u2019s identity. The New Yorker\u2019s piece was typical, concluding: \u201cThe currency is both real and elusive \u2014 just like its founder.\u201d\nIn her article and in later interviews, Ms. Goodman (who goes by the Twitter handle @truth-eater) said she had delved into databases and even worked with a team of forensic investigators to track down Mr. Nakamoto\u2019s identity. She said she got his email address from a company where he bought his model trains.\nWhile regulators debate the pros and cons of bitcoins, this volatile digital currency inspires the question: What makes money, money?\nThe disclosure of the lengths she went to investigate Mr. Nakamoto seemed only to enrage Bitcoin fans. Many on the web, and in particular on the social news site Reddit, expressed sympathy for the toll this has taken on Mr. Nakamoto, whether he is the creator of Bitcoin or not, and were outraged that Newsweek saw fit to invade his privacy.\n\u201cI hope the media realizes just how low they\u2019ve gone this time, and though I don\u2019t take any satisfaction in saying this, I hope the public backlash on them is breathtakingly vicious,\u201d wrote a commentator with the handle ferretinjapan. \nAdvertisement\nOn Friday, Newsweek issued a plea for restraint, saying in a statement that it \u201cencourages all to be respectful of the privacy and rights of the individuals involved.\u201d\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

This raises two difficult questions: Can human oversight integrate into Bitcoin\u2019s free-for-all ethos quickly enough to render Bitcoin safe? And, can Bitcoin be made safer without tamping down on the very openness that proponents say makes Bitcoin such a cheap, efficient and innovative financial platform? At the moment, the answers are still very much up in the air.\nAdvertisement\nSome in the more mainstream part of the Bitcoin world \u2014 firms that have sought venture capital and are trying to appeal to ordinary investors and large businesses \u2014 say they\u2019re up to the challenge. They are working to set up stringent technical and financial audits of trading sites, and to create insurance mechanisms so that holders of Bitcoin won\u2019t be wiped out by catastrophic losses like the one at Mt. Gox. There are even efforts to pursue government oversight.\nWhile regulators debate the pros and cons of bitcoins, this volatile digital currency inspires the question: What makes money, money?\n\u201cWe are reaching out to regulators, because we do want Bitcoin to be a regulated industry,\u201d said Brian Armstrong, the co-founder and chief executive of Coinbase, a site that allows people to purchase, store and trade with Bitcoin and that has received investments from some of Silicon Valley\u2019s leading venture firms. He said he had met with state and federal regulators to discuss Bitcoin. \u201cEven if everybody in Bitcoin doesn\u2019t believe in regulation, we think it\u2019s one way to help Bitcoin grow up and have more transactions flow over the network.\u201d\nThe most straightforward way of improving the safety of Bitcoin is also the most obvious: running independent audits of sites. Mt. Gox, which acted as a Bitcoin exchange site as well as a \u201cwallet\u201d that stored people\u2019s coins, never once offered a public accounting showing it possessed all the funds it claimed to be storing, nor showing the technical methods it was using to safeguard those funds.\nAdvertisement\nThe site\u2019s opacity will make investigating its loss more difficult. Theories about how Mt. Gox really lost all that money, and who has it now, have consumed Bitcoin discussion sites for much of the last week. Mt. Gox has said it was hacked over a period of years, apparently through a well-known but minor flaw in Bitcoin known as \u201ctransaction malleability.\u201d The flaw allows hackers to alter a Bitcoin payment while it\u2019s in progress, potentially confusing a trading site into issuing a double payment. But in the absence of an audit trail, many in the Bitcoin world have trouble believing the hacking claim. On the other hand, every other leading theory for how Mt. Gox might have lost a half-billion dollars \u2014 whether government theft or cryptographic error \u2014 has been debunked, too. It\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll never really know what happened to that half-billion dollars. It has simply vanished.\nMr. Armstrong said that to prevent something similar from ever happening at Coinbase, the firm plans to hire independent auditors to conduct a public investigation of both its Bitcoin and dollar holdings. The site also recently published a \u201csecurity audit\u201d of its technical processes, which showed it did live up to its claim of storing most of its Bitcoin holdings in \u201ccold storage,\u201d meaning on machines that are not connected to the Internet.\nAdvertisement\nThen there are more far-reaching efforts to secure Bitcoin. Elliptic, a British Bitcoin storage site, offers optional insurance on your holdings. For a fee of about 2 percent of your coins per year, the site promises to repay you if theft or negligence results in the loss of your funds. Another firm, Inscrypto, is working on what it calls a \u201cdecentralized version of the F.D.I.C.,\u201d a system similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which protects your checking account. The system, which is still a work in progress, is far more complex than traditional deposit insurance, using derivative trades to protect against price swings or other dangers of Bitcoin. At the moment, it\u2019s unclear how much it will cost, or even if it will work. The company, like several others in the Bitcoin world, declined to be quoted on the topic.\nTo some supporters of Bitcoin, the rise of these consumer protection ideas is itself proof of the digital currency\u2019s superiority over old-fashioned currency. One of Bitcoin\u2019s most cherished technical tenets is openness, the idea that anyone, anywhere, can set up a trading node on the payment network. Openness lowers barriers to entry; it allows sites with newer, safer, more innovative financial ideas to easily peddle their wares, while rickety concerns like Mt. Gox die under their own incompetence. It sets up a Darwinian race toward a safer Bitcoin.\nIn the short run, this dynamic causes terrible consequences for users, but eventually, Bitcoin\u2019s supporters say, the worst problems will get ironed out. One frequent analogy in the Bitcoin world is to the early days of the Internet and web. Just a decade and a half ago, the web was a rough-and-tumble network ruled by pornography and illegal file-trading, a place where fraud flourished and danger lurked around every corner. Today the web is still all that, but it is also, in its more respectable corners, the place where you post pictures of your children, where you shop for Christmas presents, where you hold secure conversations with your doctor and where companies make billions of dollars every year without worry of being defrauded.\n", "name": "For Bitcoin, Secure Future Might Need Oversight"}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "", "name": ""}, {"text": "Unfortunately, the Bitcoin success story has been tied intrinsically with instability, with excitement and envy for those who have become rich through investing in it \u2014 rich for a while at least, because the value of the electronic currency has fluctuated wildly. The instability of Bitcoin\u2019s value in dollars is a measure of failure, not success. It means that any commerce using Bitcoin or its competitors would be buffeted by enormous inflation and deflation.\nAdvertisement\nBut if we go back to the electronic-money drawing board, we may conclude that Bitcoin has been focused on the wrong classical functions of money, as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Bitcoin offers a way of \u201cmining\u201d electronic coins that can replace our dollar bills and bank accounts. Yet there is no fundamental need for this. Money, as we\u2019ve known it for decades, works quite well in these respects. It would be much better to focus on another classical function: money as a unit of account \u2014 that is, as a basic standard of economic measurement. Scientists spend a lot of time thinking about ways to improve systems of measurement. Business people should, too.\nThis has already begun to happen. History shows that this unit-of-account function of money has been separated from the other two, and to good purpose. For example, since 1967 in Chile, an inflation-indexed unit of account called the unidad de fomento (U.F.), meaning unit of development, has been widely used. Financial exchanges are made in pesos, according to a U.F.-peso rate posted on the website valoruf.cl. One multiplies the U.F. price by the exchange rate to arrive at the amount owed today in pesos. In this way, it is natural and easy to set inflation-indexed prices, and Chile is much more effectively inflation-indexed than other countries are.\nConsider rents. Increases may seem unfair to tenants, yet they may be needed to offset inflation. In Chile, a landlord can easily set the monthly rent for the tenant in U.F.s and then never have to change it, reducing the potential for errors, delays and misunderstandings. The name \u201cU.F.\u201d reframes people\u2019s thinking so that keeping real economic values stable is natural and easy.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address. Please re-enter.\nYou must select a newsletter to subscribe to.\nView all New York Times newsletters.\nWith electronic software in the background, we can improve on the Chilean idea and make it more useful. First, we should use more evocative words and avoid jargon. I\u2019d suggest calling the unit of account a \u201cbasket.\u201d A basket is a simple description for something rather complicated. In its basic form, it is the equivalent of one day\u2019s common consumption items, like the local marketbasket of typical purchases that already underlies the Consumer Price Index. The value from one base year would be chosen so that, with inflation, the price of a basket in local currency terms would rise.\nAdvertisement\nA second improvement could be achieved by a credit card company or an entity like PayPal or Square Cash: Set up the electronic machinery to allow people to easily send conventional money, denominated in baskets, to anyone in the world. You would just check off a box indicating whether your payment was in dollars or pesos or euros \u2014 or baskets. If you check \u201cbaskets,\u201d the computer would calculate the amount of local currency the recipient would need to buy that basket at that time, and it would transmit it, too.\nAdvertisement\nA third improvement would be to move beyond just one new unit of account to a whole system of them, so that we could have baskets for different purposes. There should be senior baskets representing items consumed by older people in one day in a given country, as well as subsistence baskets representing the consumption of the poor. There should also be a day-wage unit of account representing a day\u2019s work by an average unskilled wage earner.\nAdvertisement\nAnd there could be a \u201ctrills\u201d unit \u2014 a concept that Mark Kamstra of York University and I have been advocating \u2014 that represents one trillionth of a country\u2019s most recently estimated annual G.D.P. There should also be a unit that grows or retreats with per-capita daily consumption. This could be used for pension and Social Security payments as a form of intergenerational risk-sharing: The idea is that payments to older people would rise and fall with overall consumption. With many kinds of baskets, it will be easier to set prices and make contracts that are sensible for the long term.\nThese are ideas about simplification of complex economic calculations. But they are borrowed from behavioral economics, which has taught us that our actions are profoundly affected by framing \u2014 by the words we use and the approaches we take. And they are also ideas from cognitive linguistics, which implies that improved language, with new meanings for words like basket or day-wage, will change our thinking.\n", "name": "In Search of a Stable Electronic Currency"}, {"text": "\u201cMt.

An indictment in a parallel but separate investigation, run out of Baltimore, included this startling detail: Some of Dread Pirate Roberts\u2019s booty was spent to commission killings \u2014 six killings in total, to be done by hit men whose targets were deemed by Dread Pirate Roberts to threaten Silk Road.\nNone of the orders resulted in actual deaths, the authorities said. One, in fact, was an elaborate fiction concocted by a federal agent posing as a drug dealer. In a scene that sounds as if it were lifted from \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d federal agents traveled to Utah to fake a beating and execution, sending the evidently grisly photographs to D.P.R., as the government calls him in its complaint.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done,\u201d D.P.R. would later write to the putative dealer.\nNews of Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s arrest, and the particulars of the crimes with which he was charged, elicited the inevitable chorus of \u201cThey\u2019ve got the wrong guy\u201d from friends and relatives, an almost clich\u00e9d feature of double-life cases.

No more drives to seedy parts of town, no more face-to-face encounters with shady dealers. Instead, transactions would be conducted through the mail, and, in what many academics regard as the linchpin to the business-model innovation, Dread Pirate Roberts devised a system to ensure that nobody got fleeced.\nThe site acted as an intermediary, hosting the online market and holding money in escrow until buyers confirmed that products had arrived. D.P.R. would then release the payment to the seller, keeping 8 to 15 percent of the transaction.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe had basically commoditized security,\u201d says Nicolas Christin, an assistant research professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has studied Silk Road. \u201cIt was a system that allowed people to buy drugs without fear that they would be ripped off.\u201d\nWithin months of its start in January 2011, the site was thriving. Sellers posted photographs and descriptions of their products, like \u201c10 x 10mg OxyContin\u201d and \u201c5G Pure Cocaine Cristal.\u201d A guide offered tips for newcomers.

Schumer of New York and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia were demanding that the Justice Department close Silk Road. But the site had only begun to catch on.

A \u201cservices\u201d section with 159 offerings included a tutorial on hacking automated teller machines. More than 800 listings offered \u201cdigital goods,\u201d such as hacked Netflix accounts, and 169 listings in \u201cforgeries,\u201d including driver\u2019s licenses and car insurance records.\nAdvertisement\nAnyone with minimal computer literacy could access this superstore of criminal mischief.

But accumulating that wealth came with its share of management migraines. One of the biggest involved an employee named Curtis Clark Green, a burly man whose colorful past includes a stint as a semipro poker player and charges of prescription fraud. From his home in Spanish Fork, Utah, the government said, he sold drugs on Silk Road under the name \u201cchronicpain,\u201d and eventually he built enough trust with D.P.R. to become one of his lieutenants.\nIn early December 2012, D.P.R. needed Mr. Green for a special task. A dealer who operated under the alias \u201cnob\u201d had complained that Silk Road transactions were too small to be worth his time. Mr. Green was to find someone willing to play in the same league.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHey, I think we have a buyer for you,\u201d D.P.R. subsequently wrote to nob. \u201cOne of my staff is sending details.\u201d\nNob, however, was not a dealer. He was a member of Operation Marco Polo, a task force based in Baltimore that was named for the explorer who followed the Silk Road and that included agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and Homeland Security Investigations. (No one from any of the investigating agencies would comment on the case.) When Mr. Green helped nob arrange the sale of a kilogram of cocaine, in early 2012, he did something that is hard to explain: he offered to act as a conduit and have the cocaine sent to his house. Mr. Green was soon arrested. He was quickly released and the kilogram was sent, as planned, to the buyer, presumably to prevent D.P.R. from realizing that one of his underlings had been caught.\nDread Pirate Roberts did somehow learn of the arrest, but he still didn\u2019t realize he was communicating with a federal agent who had arranged it. He was soon fuming to nob that Mr. Green had absconded with Bitcoins, and D.P.R. asked for help.\n\u201cI\u2019d like him beat up, then forced to send the Bitcoins he stole back,\u201d D.P.R. wrote. \u201cLike sit him down at his computer and make him do it.\u201d Soon, D.P.R. had a change of heart. \u201cCan you change the order to execute rather than torture?\u201d he asked nob, explaining, \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll give up info.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nNob told D.P.R. that he knew \u201cpros\u201d who could get the job done. The cost was $40,000 in Bitcoins up front, and $40,000 after the killing.\nDread Pirate Roberts agreed to the price but wanted \u201cproof of death,\u201d asking nob to instruct the killers to send a video, \u201cand if they can\u2019t do that, then pictures\u201d of the deceased.\nAdvertisement\nOnly the broad outlines are known of what must have been a highly cinematic dumb show of violence. What is clear from the criminal complaint is that by Feb. 21, nob sent photos of Mr. Green doing a fine impression of a corpse. Mr. Green had \u201cdied of asphyxiation/heart rupture\u201d while being tortured, nob explained. Dread Pirate Roberts replied that he found the images disturbing, but that he did not have any other choice.\n\u201cI just wish more people had some integrity,\u201d D.P.R. wrote.\nIn the months that followed, D.P.R. would pay a supposed hit man named \u201credandwhite\u201d $150,000 in Bitcoins to whack a blackmailer who was threatening to release the identities of Silk Road users, and later a seller who appears to have scammed buyers en masse. When redandwhite noted that the scammer lived with three roommates, D.P.R. was persuaded to kill all four of them, at a cost of $500,000.\nAdvertisement\nThe government contends that the whole enterprise was likely a swindle. Whether these targets were in cahoots with redandwhite, or were the creation of redandwhite, is not clear. But authorities in Canada, where all five killings were supposed to have taken place, found no trace of crimes that matched redandwhite\u2019s descriptions, according to federal prosecutors.\nNonetheless, D.P.R.\u2019s willingness to underwrite killings would become an argument against bail, which was presented in November by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, where Ross Ulbricht was transferred soon after his arrest. (The F.B.I. ran its case out of Manhattan.) Today, Mr. Ulbricht awaits trial in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.\nThe Forgiving Kind \nLyn Ulbricht, Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s mother, sat one recent morning in the downtown Manhattan office of her son\u2019s lawyer. She had flown in from Austin a few days earlier, to look for a place where she and her husband could live to be close to their son.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI can\u2019t be somewhere else while he\u2019s in jail,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to visit him. We believe in him, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nRoss Ulbricht grew up in a suburb of Austin that his mother described as the poorest neighborhood in a good school district. She and her husband, Kirk, earn most of their income renting four beachside vacation houses they own in Costa Rica. Ross is remembered by friends as bright, though not whiz-kid bright, part of a circle that mostly avoided the football culture that dominated high school.\n\u201cHe was outdoorsy,\u201d said James McFarland, who met Mr. Ulbricht in a physics class. \u201cWe played a lot of ultimate Frisbee, hiking, swimming, that sort of thing.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMr. McFarland and others say he was shy around girls, sweet-natured, loyal to friends and a fan of intense philosophical conversations. He was also an unusual combination of rule follower and rule breaker. He did a lot of drugs, as he explained in that StoryCorps conversation, likening his intake to a guy who jumped into the deep end of a pool and stayed underwater for as long as he could hold his breath. At the same time, he collected enough merit badges to become that emblem of teenage all-Americanness, an Eagle Scout.\nBy the time he went to the University of Texas at Dallas, on a full academic scholarship, he was 6-foot-2, a lean, good-looking guy who could have fronted an indie rock band. But he was the opposite of a Lothario. He was vulnerable and eager to find a soul mate, and fell hard for that college girlfriend. The two were engaged, according to Thomas Haney, but it ended when Ross learned that she had cheated with one of his closest buddies.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI\u2019d have killed the guy, but Ross completely forgave him within a year of it happening,\u201d Mr. Haney said. That was Ross\u2019s style, not just willing to forgive, but empathetic to the point of mushy. At a bachelor party held in the woods two years ago for a friend named Daniel, Mr. Haney said, everyone was sitting around, kind of stumped about what to do.\n\u201cThen Ross pipes up,\u201d Mr. Haney said, \u201cand he said, \u2018Let\u2019s go around in a circle and say why we love Daniel.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nAfter graduating in 2006 with a degree in physics, Mr. Ulbricht headed to Penn State, where he earned a master\u2019s degree in material sciences and engineering. His thesis, \u201cGrowth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy,\u201d is still available at the school\u2019s online archives.\nAdvertisement\nHe later returned to Austin and was a co-founder of Good Wagon Books, which collected used books from around the city and sold them online, donating 10 percent of profits to charities. But the venture failed, and Mr. Ulbricht started what he described to acquaintances as a hedge fund, trading stocks and currencies, including Bitcoin. Friends had the impression that it was not going well, especially after other people started to give him money to invest, which made him overly cautious.\nAt the invitation of Mr. Pinnell, Mr. Ulbricht relocated to San Francisco in 2012. When Mr. Pinnell became engaged, Mr. Ulbricht moved into a group house, where he told roommates that his name was Joshua Terrey, according to an article in Forbes. In August, two months before he was arrested, he abruptly left that house for another, without explanation.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address. Please re-enter.\nYou must select a newsletter to subscribe to.\nView all New York Times newsletters.\nHis new accommodations were hardly those of a drug lord. He paid $1,100 a month for a 12-by-14-foot room, sharing a house with three roommates. One of those roommates said that they knew him by his real name and that he told them he earned a living by building and managing websites.\nNothing about him seemed out of the ordinary, until he was arrested. That day, his roommates returned to their house to find a search warrant left by the F.B.I. on the coffee table in the living room.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe F.B.I. came back a bunch of times and asked questions for hours,\u201d the roommate said. \u201cWe were in shock. It really was about a week before I felt normal.\u201d\nNine Fake IDs\nHow did the F.B.I. connect Dread Pirate Roberts to Ross Ulbricht? That is still a mystery. Mr. Ulbricht certainly left more than a few digital crumbs, according to the government\u2019s complaint and a variety of online rubberneckers who followed the case. The first mention of Silk Road online, in January 2011, by someone called \u201caltoid,\u201d was followed a few months later by a user with the same alias on a Bitcoin Talk forum. This person was searching for an I.T. pro for hire. Applicants were asked to email \u201crossulbricht at gmail dot com.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBut this was only enough to make Mr. Ulbricht a person of interest. In July 2013, Customs and Border Protection intercepted a package from Canada bound for his address. The package contained nine fake IDs, each bearing a photograph of Mr. Ulbricht and a different name, with addresses in a variety of states and countries.\nAdvertisement\nOn July 26, agents of Homeland Security Investigations knocked on the door of Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s group house. \u201cJosh,\u201d as he then was calling himself, refused to answer most of the agents\u2019 questions, the government would say later.\nThough Mr. Ulbricht did not take the opportunity to skedaddle, he apparently had considered it. The government would say later that his laptop contained a filled-out application for \u201ceconomic citizenship\u201d in Dominica, a Caribbean island. The price was a one-time donation of $75,000 to the country\u2019s government.\nAdvertisement\nThe crucial breakthrough in the case occurred a few weeks after that fake ID package was intercepted. The F.B.I. located and copied the contents of Silk Road\u2019s main servers, the computers that powered the site\u2019s operations and stored its data.\nIt is here that the government\u2019s otherwise detailed account gets fuzzy. The F.B.I. has stated only that the main server was found in \u201ca certain foreign country,\u201d one that has a mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States. Through the treaty, the F.B.I. was given a copy of the server \u2014 a \u201cmirror\u201d of it, in tech terms \u2014 on July 23. The site continued to operate, so D.P.R. would not be spooked.\nWhat is unclear is how the feds knew where the servers were. Presumably, they were rented in some faraway corners of the globe \u2014 Iceland, Latvia and Romania are likely, according to experts who have studied the I.P. addresses. But the official vagueness has provoked speculation in academic circles and among security specialists. Was the National Security Agency involved? Did this process involve breaking laws, or violating constitutional rights?\nAdvertisement\nThat issue will be at the heart of Ross Ulbricht\u2019s defense strategy, says Joshua L. Dratel, his lawyer, whose clients include a Guant\u00e1namo detainee.\u201cIt\u2019s called the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine,\u201d Mr. Dratel explained. \u201cIf you think of the acquisitions of evidence as a chain, if you find one bad link, everything on the other side of that link is suppressible.\u201d\nIn other words, if Mr. Dratel can prove that the government acted improperly when it found and copied that server, all the evidence it gathered after that \u2014 including the laptop taken in that Oct. 1 arrest \u2014 could be tossed out of court.\nMr. Dratel said he would also argue that Mr. Ulbricht is not Dread Pirate Roberts. But that contention could be hard to square with a sworn statement by Mr. Ulbricht, filed with the court Dec. 12. It says the Bitcoins seized from the laptop should be returned to him, because he \u201chas an interest as an owner/possessor\u201d of the money.\nAdvertisement\nThis seems a tricky needle for Mr. Ulbricht to thread. He is denying that he is Dread Pirate Roberts but demanding what the government maintains is D.P.R.\u2019s money. How did Mr. Ulbricht earn millions in virtual dollars, if not through Silk Road commissions?\nMr. Dratel declined to say, citing a reluctance to discuss the facts of the case.\n\u2018A Revolution of Epic Proportions\u2019\nAdvertisement\nThe 2012 StoryCorps video ends with Rene Pinnell asking where Mr. Ulbricht hopes to be in 20 years.\n\u201cTwenty years, uh,\u201d says Mr. Ulbricht, tugging at his facial hair and looking sideways. After a pause, he looks directly at Mr. Pinnell and says, \u201cI want to have had a substantial positive impact on the future of humanity by that time.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMr. Pinnell laughs, because that sounds so ambitious that it initially comes across as a joke. But Mr. Ulbricht isn\u2019t laughing.\n\u201cDo you think you\u2019re going to live forever?\u201d Mr. Pinnell asks, getting serious.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a possibility,\u201d says Mr. Ulbricht, allowing a grin.\nAdvertisement\nAgain, his friend chuckles.\n\u201cI honestly do,\u201d Mr. Ulbricht says with a smile. \u201cI think I might live forever in some form, by that time. I mean technology is changing so fast.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMr. Pinnell does not pose the obvious follow-up \u2014 what are you talking about? How exactly do you plan to transition from day trader-with-a-laptop to historical figure? None of Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s friends, it seems, had an answer for that one, perhaps because they didn\u2019t know enough about his interior life.\nAdvertisement\nMost grasped that he\u2019d long been a searcher, a restless mind rummaging around for a philosophy. For years, he was fascinated by Eastern mysticism, and briefly was an advocate of the Landmark Forum, a three-day seminar intended to give participants \u201cthe power to make what you\u2019re committed to into a reality,\u201d as the company\u2019s website says.\nWhat few friends realized is where his philosophical quest had brought him. At Penn State, he was becoming a dedicated libertarian. He joined the school\u2019s Libertarian Club and wore a Ron Paul for President shirt to classes. Mr. Ulbricht was quoted in the school\u2019s newspaper, The Daily Collegian, saying of Mr. Paul, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot to learn from him and his message of what it means to be a U.S. citizen and what it means to be a free individual.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBy the time Mr. Ulbricht left Penn State, his views had taken on a vehemently anti-tax tone. A friend in Austin said Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s politics at the time were more \u201chard core\u201d than his own.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI\u2019d say \u2018Less government but we need the government to build roads,\u2019\u00a0\u201d this friend said. \u201cBut for him, even when it came to building roads, he felt there ought to be a voluntary basis for that. The point for him wasn\u2019t to abolish government. He just thought people should have the ability to opt out of paying taxes.\u201d\nThese views weren\u2019t a secret. Not long after graduating from Penn State, he wrote on his LinkedIn page that his interest in physics had waned.\n\u201cNow, my goals have shifted,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and aggression amongst mankind.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nInstitutions and government were the problem, he continued. Which is why he was \u201ccreating an economic simulation to give people a firsthand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.\u201d\nWas Silk Road that economic simulation? Without question, Dread Pirate Roberts considered the site a means to \u201cabolish the use of coercion.\u201d He routinely proclaimed so, in postings that sound like a mash-up of manifesto and infomercial.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI walk tall, proud and free, knowing that the actions I take eat away at the infrastructure that keeps oppression alive,\u201d D.P.R. wrote on Silk Road in March 2012. \u201cNow it is profitable to throw off one\u2019s chains, with amazing crypto technology reducing the risk of doing so dramatically. How many niches have yet to be filled in the world of anonymous online markets? The opportunity to prosper and take part in a revolution of epic proportions is at our fingertips!\u201d\nDread Pirate Roberts considered his work epochal because he was not just promoting the sale of illicit goods. He was reimagining the fundamentals of commerce.\nFor centuries, consumers have been taxed by governments or overlords of one type or another, rendering unto Caesar for as long as there have been Caesars. But if Silk Road were scalable, that era was over. Or at least imperiled. Anyone would have the option to sell goods undisturbed by regulations and without sharing a percentage of revenue with the state. And why stop at drugs? The system would work for legal products, too. The tools are there for a kind of subterranean Amazon.com.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt could literally change the world as we know it,\u201d D.P.R. wrote of Silk Road in an online exhortation.\nA man who created a website that changed the world as we know it could believe he had a chance to live forever. At minimum, he could be a hero to anyone who thinks that government has no business in business.\nAdvertisement\nRoss Ulbricht and Dread Pirate Roberts have other similarities, including a fondness for the Ludwig von Mises Institute, part of the Austrian School of Economics, which was celebrated by Mr. Ulbricht on his Google+ page and by D.P.R. in Silk Road pep talks.\nAdvertisement\nThis could be a coincidence. It could also be a coincidence that neither man nor pseudonym seemed motivated by greed. Mr. Ulbricht\u2019s lifestyle was one notch above that of urban couch surfer. And the primary goal that D.P.R. professed was to unshackle humanity from what he regarded as economic tyranny. If a handful of miscreants \u2014 and yes, a few of their unfortunate roommates \u2014 were killed along the way, that is a shame. But Silk Road was like a tunnel under the gulag, and D.P.R. was digging for the sake of humanity.\n\u201cIt needs everything we have,\u201d D.P.R. wrote of Silk Road, urging buyers and sellers to grasp its significance. \u201cDo it for me, do it for yourself, do it for your families and friends, and do it for mankind.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps this is where Dread Pirate Roberts, the criminal mastermind, overlaps with Ross Ulbricht, the guy who aided a homeless woman in a wheelchair. With aching sincerity, they both really wanted to help.\nRoads Closed?\nThe success of Silk Road raised the prospect that the thuggish street drug dealer, the stock character of countless police procedurals, could be replaced by a geek in a coffee shop with a laptop. But in the months since Silk Road was shut down, several sites have tried to takes its place and all have failed.\nOne of them, called the Sheep Marketplace, went dark in December, as users howled that administrators had made off with as much as $44 million in Bitcoins. Project: Black Flag lasted a few weeks in October, before its leader announced, \u201cI was unable to cope with the stress and constant demand, so I panicked.\u201d Metta Dread Pirate Roberts, as that site\u2019s fearful leader was known, then absconded with an unknown sum of Bitcoins, according to news reports.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI suspect that the online drug marketplace is a passing fad because it\u2019s too traceable, too vulnerable to hacking,\u201d said Mr. Weaver at the International Computer Science Institute. Once Bitcoins are converted to another currency, the government can subpoena the records of the exchange where the transaction took place and harvest all the information it needs. \u201cBitcoin isn\u2019t really a \u2018coin\u2019 as much as a distributed, public balance ledger,\u201d Mr. Weaver added, \u201cwith every balance and transaction recorded.\u201d\n", "name": "Eagle Scout.

Back in 1936 the economist John Maynard Keynes argued that increased government spending was needed to restore full employment. But then, as now, there was strong political resistance to any such proposal. So Keynes whimsically suggested an alternative: have the government bury bottles full of cash in disused coal mines, and let the private sector spend its own money to dig the cash back up. It would be better, he agreed, to have the government build roads, ports and other useful things \u2014 but even perfectly useless spending would give the economy a much-needed boost.\nAdvertisement\nClever stuff \u2014 but Keynes wasn\u2019t finished. He went on to point out that the real-life activity of gold mining was a lot like his thought experiment. Gold miners were, after all, going to great lengths to dig cash out of the ground, even though unlimited amounts of cash could be created at essentially no cost with the printing press. And no sooner was gold dug up than much of it was buried again, in places like the gold vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where hundreds of thousands of gold bars sit, doing nothing in particular.\nKeynes would, I think, have been sardonically amused to learn how little has changed in the past three generations. Public spending to fight unemployment is still anathema; miners are still spoiling the landscape to add to idle hoards of gold. (Keynes dubbed the gold standard a \u201cbarbarous relic.\u201d) Bitcoin just adds to the joke.

Yet that represented a small fraction of those affected, and the company said it still remained unlikely that people would regain control of their computers if they paid the online fee.\nAdvertisement\nThe tally of ransom payments may rise ahead of Friday\u2019s deadline, but cybersecurity experts say the current numbers \u2014 both total ransom money paid and machines decrypted \u2014 are far short of early estimates forecasting that the digital attack may eventually cost victims hundreds of millions of dollars in combined ransom fees.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI predict this may be an epic failure,\u201d said Kim Peretti, a former senior litigator in the Department of Justice\u2019s computer crime and intellectual property division who now is co-chairwoman of the cybersecurity preparedness and response team at Alston & Bird, an international law firm. \u201cBecause of the publicity of this attack and the public\u2019s awareness of people potentially not getting their files back, the figures aren\u2019t as high as people had first thought.\u201d\nFor victims of such attacks, the potential loss of personal or business files can be traumatic. In typical ransomware cases, including the most recent hack, assailants send an encrypted email to potential targets. The message includes a malware attachment that takes over their machines if opened. The attackers then demand payment before returning control of the computers, often through money paid into bitcoin or other largely untraceable online currencies.\nThe latest ransomware strike, experts said, was particularly virulent because it was based on malicious software stolen from the National Security Agency. Law enforcement agencies from the United States, Britain and elsewhere have been tracking the potential culprits, with suspicions now focusing on hackers in North Korea.\nAdvertisement\nFor Randy Meyers, a technology consultant for a rural hospital in western Texas, the recent ransomware attack has brought back bitter memories.\nAdvertisement\nLast month, Mr. Meyers discovered that a similar virus had taken over critical computers at a 25-bed medical facility in Fisher County, roughly a three-hour drive from Fort Worth. The virus locked physicians and other medical staff out of patient records, and his repeated pleas by email to the attackers to unlock the vital machines went unanswered.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Still, he said, the attack had crippled the hospital for four days, with doctors and nurses resorting to pen and paper.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like going home and finding out you\u2019ve been broken into,\u201d said Mr. Meyers, who said he had never before experienced such an attack in more than 20 years as a technology consultant. \u201cYou never want to have to pay the ransom. It gives them a reason to do it again and again.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nFor some organizations, particularly government agencies, paying to decrypt locked-out computers is not even an option. In many countries, including across Europe and Asia, the payment of any form of ransom is forbidden by laws often written to counter terrorist attacks in the offline world. That means organizations like Britain\u2019s National Health Service, among the worst affected in the recent ransomware attacks, are left with few options to retrieve data that can have life-or-death implications.\nIn the United States, there is no nationwide policy outlawing such ransomware payments. But experts still warn against handing over money because it may lead to far more significant costs down the road.\nAdvertisement\nExclusion and cooperation clauses in many cyberinsurance policies expressly prohibit businesses from paying such digital ransoms without pre-approval. If a victim hands over the money anyway, insurers may cancel a business\u2019s coverage and leave clients paying out of pocket \u2014 including covering the cost of disruptions to their businesses, remediation expenses and customer notifications.\n\u201cIn general, the advice is not to pay,\u201d said Kevin Kalinich, a global cyber-risk expert at Aon, the insurance broker. \u201cThe perpetrators may not release your data, or you\u2019ll be considered a target for future attacks.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nJorge Reza, a sales manager for a construction business in Laredo, Tex., was forced to take that gamble when the company he works for was hit with a ransomware attack last year.\nAdvertisement\nHours after one of his colleagues was locked out of the business\u2019s main computer, which held company invoices, payroll data and other sensitive information, Mr. Reza, 34, found himself online, researching how to open a bitcoin account and other tips for paying the digital ransom.\nDespite fears the assailants would not unlock the computer, Mr. Reza uploaded money through Western Union, found someone who would sell him $1,200 worth of bitcoin and waited for notification that the machine had been returned to his control. The process, Mr. Reza said, was both stressful and uncertain, as he could not be sure the attackers would follow through on their promises.

In the United States, a company called Coinbase will link to your bank account or credit card and then sell you the coins for American dollars. Opening an account with Coinbase is similar to opening a traditional bank or stock brokerage account, with lots of verification of your identity needed.\nAdvertisement\nFor people who do not want to reveal their identities, there are services like LocalBitcoins that will connect local people who want to buy and sell Bitcoin for cash, generally without any verification of identity required.\nAdvertisement\nTo start accepting Bitcoin is even easier. One needs only to create a Bitcoin address, which can be done anonymously by anyone with internet access.\nAdvertisement\nThe price of Bitcoin fluctuates constantly and is determined by open-market bidding on Bitcoin exchanges, similar to the way that stock and gold prices are determined by bidding on exchanges.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Law enforcement or financial authorities can sometimes use the blockchain to track transactions among criminals. But as long as the criminals do not associate a real-world identity with their Bitcoin address, they are generally safe. Complicating matters further, there are increasingly sophisticated Bitcoin laundering services, known as tumblers, which mix large quantities of transactions together in order to make it harder for the authorities to track the transactions.\nWhere it can get more difficult for hackers is when they want to convert the Bitcoin they have received into a traditional national currency. Most companies that convert Bitcoin to dollars in the United States require that their customers provide identification. If a criminal registered with a company like that, it would be relatively easy for the police to track them down.\nBut there are many Bitcoin exchanges outside the United States that do not require customers to register with a real-world identity. LocalBitcoins also makes it easy to find someone in any city around the world who will meet you in person and pay cash for Bitcoin without requiring any identification \u2014 a sort of Craigslist for Bitcoin exchanges. It is also getting easier to buy goods online using Bitcoin, without ever converting the digital currency into dollars or euros.\nAdvertisement\nThe price of Bitcoin has been rising, and recently hit a high above $2,000. Like gold, the price of Bitcoin has always been driven by the scarcity of the digital tokens. When Bitcoin was created in 2009, it was determined that only 21 million coins would ever be created.\nAdvertisement\nTechnology investors have purchased coins and pushed up the price out of a belief that the tokens and the system will be a sort of global digital currency and financial network for the future.\nWhile real-world transactions have been slow to take off, Bitcoin has continued to be popular for black market uses like ransomware and online drug markets like the Silk Road and its successors.\nAdvertisement\nThe corporate world has also taken interest in the technology that enables Bitcoin, especially its decentralized financial network and the blockchain, the global ledger where all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. Many banks are making big bets that real-world financial transactions will one day be run on networks similar to Bitcoin, which can operate more quickly, efficiently and securely than traditional financial networks.\nThere are now many competitors to Bitcoin, like Ethereum, and their value has also been pushed up by growing interest in the Bitcoin technology. But Bitcoin has remained the largest so-called cryptocurrency and is generally the one that people use to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies.\n", "name": "What Is Bitcoin?

Europol said its team of cybersecurity specialists \u2014 made up of agents from countries like Germany, Britain and the United States \u2014 was investigating the attack.\nEurope and Asia were the regions most affected by the crime, with hospitals, car plants and even the Russian Ministry of Interior falling prey to the malware, which takes over a computer, locks down the machine and releases it only when the owner has paid a ransom.\nAdvertisement\nHours after the attack was first reported in Britain, where the computer systems of the National Health Service were crippled, law enforcement agencies across Europe, Asia and the United States began looking for clues that could trace the assault to specific people or organizations.\nAdvertisement\nAs with a physical crime scene, the first step with any cyberinvestigation is to make sure the criminal is no longer hiding out, about to pounce again.\n\u201cBefore we get into who did it, we try to figure out if the bad guys still have access,\u201d said Theresa Payton, a former chief information officer of the White House and founder of Fortalice, a cybersecurity firm. \u201cAre they still hiding?

Patricia Lewis, the international security research director at Chatham House in London, likened the text of the email to a physical letter and its metadata to the envelope it arrives in.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAn envelope has lots of information on it: the stamp with the time and place it was sent from, the handwriting or printer type, a sender\u2019s address, maybe a fingerprint or DNA from saliva on the seal,\u201d Ms. Lewis said.\nAdvertisement\nCriminals are aware their emails contain revealing clues, and they try to cover their tracks. \u201cPeople use cloakers, which hide your identity, making you look as if you are someone and somewhere else,\u201d she said.\nLike tracing the license plates of a stolen car back to the wrong person, this can lead investigators astray. \u201cBut a good detective can track them,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cThey always leave digital bread crumbs that can be followed.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nInvestigators will check whether the email address the malware came from is linked to social media accounts, past cybercrimes or other locations on the web. They will study the domain name it is linked to. And they will look for patterns to try to connect one crime to others.\nAdvertisement\nSuccess often depends on whether law enforcement can tie small digital details, including potential mistakes or a certain style in the programming code, back to the criminals. The location of where some of the ransom money is withdrawn can also help connect the dots.\nSometimes the patterns that lead investigators to their target can be surprising. One state-sponsored hack was traced to Russia because detectives noticed those responsible were online only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Moscow time, Ms. Lewis recalled. In another case, hackers were observing Chinese holidays.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Sony was hacked, officials linked the malware that was used to one that had been used before in North Korea. \u201cThat was a big clue,\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \u201cBut of course it could have been deliberately planted.\u201d\nIn the recent hack of the political campaign of the new  president of France, Emmanuel Macron, for instance, security experts were able to link the registration of certain website domains used in the attack to Russian hackers.\nInvestigators in the latest attack are looking for clues in the ransom notes written in more than 20 languages. Some suggested that the assailants might have connections to China because the Mandarin version of the text was better written than its English equivalent.\nAdvertisement\nOnce equipped with enough identifying data to start narrowing down suspects, investigators will go undercover to listen to the chatter on technology boards where cybercriminals are known to spend time. \u201cIt\u2019s like using an undercover operative purporting to be part of a criminal gang, except it\u2019s online,\u201d Mr. Inkster said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHalf the dark web are cyberagents these days,\u201d Ms. Lewis joked. \u201cThey\u2019re tripping over each other.\u201d\nOne of the most challenging new developments for investigators is the use of Bitcoin, a digital currency with little oversight.\nAdvertisement\nIn the latest attack, the criminals demanded ransoms ranging from $300 to $600, to be paid in Bitcoin.\nBitcoin accounts, or wallets, are extremely difficult to trace. While law enforcement agencies have cracked cases by tracking Bitcoin transactions, the process is arduous.\nAdvertisement\n", "name": "How to Catch Hackers?

For years, there have been stories of individuals or companies horrified that they have been locked out of their computers and that the only way back in is to pay a ransom to someone, somewhere who has managed to take control.\nAdvertisement\nBut computer criminals are discovering that ransomware is the most effective way to make money in the shortest amount of time. The advent of new tools that wrap victims\u2019 data with tough encryption technology, hard-to-trace digital currency like Bitcoin, and even online sites that offer to do the data ransoming in return for a piece of the action, have made this method of cybertheft much easier.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to have any skills to do this anymore,\u201d said Jason Rebholz, a senior director at the Crypsis Group who has helped dozens of victims of ransomware.\nRansomware has allowed people who are not computer experts to become computer thieves. It used to be that hackers had to be a little creative and skilled to get money out of people. There were fake antivirus scams that promised to clean up your computer \u2014 for a fee.\nAdvertisement\nSometimes they resorted to so-called Trojan horse programs that lay in wait on e-commerce or banking sites, ready to get your credit card numbers. And there was old-fashioned hacking, grabbing all sorts of personal credentials that could be sold on the so-called dark web.\nAdvertisement\nFour years ago, investigators were pursuing roughly 16 variants of ransomware that were predominantly being used on victims in Eastern Europe. Now there are dozens of types of ransomware, and they are supported by an entire underground industry. And catching and convicting the people responsible is difficult.\nAdvertisement\nFriday\u2019s attacks were a powerful escalation of earlier, much smaller episodes. Hackers exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft servers that was first discovered by the National Security Agency and then leaked online by a group of unknown hackers last month. It allowed the ransomware to spread from server to server, encrypting as many files as it could, and holding more than 70,000 organizations victim in the process.\nAs of Saturday afternoon, several Bitcoin accounts associated with the ransomware had received the equivalent of $33,000, according to Elliptic, a firm that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies. And the number could grow.\nThe attack should not have been a shock. As data has become our lifeline, cybercriminals have elevated their game and their demands. Just five years ago, attackers in Eastern Europe were locking up victims\u2019 computers and demanding ransoms of $100 to $400 to unlock them.\nAdvertisement\nBack then, the idea of paying a criminal on the internet was still foreign, and most important, technicians and security experts could find ways to unlock computers without caving on the ransom. In 2012, security experts estimated that  less than 3 percent of victims paid.\nAdvertisement\nThese days, it\u2019s a 50-50 split between those who pay the ransom and those who refuse, either because they have adequate backups, are philosophically opposed or simply cannot afford to pay.\nRansoms now range from as little as one Bitcoin, which equates to roughly $1,700, to as many as 30 Bitcoin, nearly $51,000, with the median ransom equating to four Bitcoin, or nearly $7,000, according to researchers at the Crypsis Group.\nBitcoin has given cybercriminals an easy and anonymous way to get their profits, and it is much harder to track than credit cards or wire transfers.\nAdvertisement\nThere is even now a concept of \u201cransomware as a service\u201d \u2014 a play on the Silicon Valley jargon \u201csoftware as a service,\u201d which describes the delivery of software over the internet.\nAdvertisement\nNow anyone can visit a web page, generate a ransomware file with the click of a mouse, encrypt someone\u2019s systems and demand a ransom to restore access to the files.

There are even live chat options. And while some amateur ransomware attackers may not restore victims\u2019 data once the ransom is paid, the more professional outfits worry that if they do not decrypt a victim\u2019s data, their reputation and \u201cbusiness\u201d may suffer as a result, Mr. Rebholz said.\nThe most notorious of these attackers, a group called SamSam after its type of ransomware, is known for demanding the highest ransoms, 25 to 30 Bitcoin. But they reliably decrypt a victim\u2019s data after being paid.\nAdvertisement\nMost small- to medium-size businesses pay the ransoms because they do not have backups of their data and feel they have no other option, Mr. Rebholz said. \u201cThat data is the bloodline of their business in many cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can either go out of business or pay the ransom.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nCybercriminals have also found a soft target in universities, which usually have more open systems that allow for the free flow of information.\nMore recently, they have found a niche in health care, where ransomware attacks take on a new level of urgency as doctors and emergency rooms in Britain discovered on Friday when hackers blocked their access to patient records, and patients had to be turned away.\nAdvertisement\nImperial College Healthcare in London, for example, was hit with ransomware 19 times over 12 months, according to freedom-of-information requests submitted by SentinelOne, a security firm.\nAdvertisement\nIn the United States, the number of reported ransomware attacks rose fourfold between 2015 and 2016, as did the ransom payments to hackers, to $1 billion, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nLast year hospitals in California, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and Texas were hit with ransomware. And in February, a Los Angeles hospital paid $17,000 to hackers to regain access to its computers.\nAdvertisement\nOn Wednesday, Dr. Krishna Chinthapalli published an article in the British Medical Journal warning that such an attack was imminent. Dr. Chinthapalli cited a report that one out of every three British National Health Service trusts, the health care providers that serve specific geographic regions or offer specialized mental health or ambulance services, were hit by ransomware last year.\n\u201cIn the past three months, health care providers have been preparing themselves for these attacks, either with Bitcoin at the ready or with professional incident responders,\u201d said Chris Camacho, the chief strategy officer at Flashpoint, a New York company that tracked Friday\u2019s attacks.\nNearly half of ransomware attacks begin by persuading an employee to click on an email. Sometimes the methods used by cybercriminals are more complex. A \u201cwatering hole attack,\u201d for example, infects a website with ransomware code. When users visit the site, that code is downloaded onto their machine.\nAdvertisement\nThe other half, Mr. Rebholz and others said, target victims with \u201cbrute force\u201d methods: Hackers scan an organization for software vulnerabilities, weak passwords or other unlocked digital doors. After that, ransomware attackers try to encrypt as many files as possible. The SamSam group is known to move from file to file, manually encrypting hundreds of systems, so it can demand the highest in Bitcoin ransoms, according to the Crypsis Group, Symantec and others.\nAdvertisement\nIt seems no one is immune. In January, a hacker held hostage a small cancer charity in Indiana, wiping the organization\u2019s main and backup servers and demanding 50 Bitcoin \u2014 more than $87,000 \u2014 in return for restoring their data. They did not pay.\n", "name": "With New Digital Tools, Even Nonexperts Can Wage Cyberattacks"}, {"text": "The lack of such regulation, the commission said, raised \u201cconcerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this market.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe price of Bitcoin has climbed sharply in recent weeks in anticipation of the commission approving the Winklevoss brothers\u2019 fund, with the price of a single Bitcoin surging to a record high above $1,300.\nBitcoin aficionados had hoped that an exchange-traded fund would help bring the virtual currency into the mainstream by making it available to retail investors through brokerage firms like Charles Schwab and eTrade.\nSeveral other companies have also applied to operate Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, and the S.E.C. could reach a different decision on those proposed funds.

The virtual currency emerged in 2009 and was celebrated for its ability to circumvent government authorities.\nAdvertisement\nSince then, Bitcoin has gained prominence partly because of its use on shadowy online black markets, where it is exchanged for drugs, and in countries like China and Venezuela, where some citizens are looking to evade government oversight.\nOver time, it has become clear that Bitcoin\u2019s growth prospects are probably limited if it is not easily available through regulated institutions to ordinary investors.\nAdvertisement\nJerry Brito, executive director of the Coin Center, a virtual currency advocacy group, said that the S.E.C.\u2019s decision presented a problem for the further development of the technology.\n\u201cHow do we develop well-capitalized and regulated markets in the U.S. and Europe if financial innovators aren\u2019t allowed to bring products to market that grow domestic demand for digital currencies like Bitcoin?\u201d Mr. Brito said in a statement on Friday.\n", "name": "S.E.C.

Walmart is just one of 400 IBM clients testing it out, and IBM now has around 650 employees dedicated to the technology.\nThe most immediate business opportunities are in the financial world as a tool to track and trade stocks, bonds and other assets. But in the next week, Maersk, the global shipping giant, is expected to announce it is using IBM\u2019s version of the blockchain to track the avocados, flowers and machine parts it carries on its enormous cargo ships.

Many banks are concerned that IBM could push them into a version of the blockchain that would lock them into IBM\u2019s software.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe believe with 100 percent certainty that it\u2019s going to matter,\u201d Mark Russinovich, the head of Microsoft\u2019s blockchain efforts, said of the technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of where\u2019s its going to matter and how it\u2019s going to matter.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBut while the public focused on stories like these, geeks became fascinated with Bitcoin\u2019s underlying structure and the communal way in which it was updated. That database was referred to as the blockchain because all the transactions were sorted into \u201cblocks,\u201d and each block was chained, using sophisticated math, to the ones before it, all the way back to the very first transaction \u2014 a structure that makes it tough for anyone to change the records after the fact.\nIn 2014, a handful of IBM employees began building their own version of Bitcoin, known as Blue Coin, which could be used to track financial transactions, totally independent of Bitcoin. But it was a small, exploratory project with no real support inside IBM.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI was prepared to tell them to shut it down, that cybercurrency is not our role to play,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, director of research at IBM.\nAdvertisement\nBut a team kept working on the technology, changing the name to Bluechain and then to Openchain. And Mr. Krishna eventually invited his team to a meeting at IBM\u2019s central lab in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., for one last chance to defend the technology.\nThey explained that this was about more than just a currency \u2014 it was a new way of tracking shipments and transactions in supply chains of all kinds, from food to prescription drugs to diamonds. Because all the participants would be keeping their own live version of all the data, without a central authority, they could immediately see everything that was going on and trust that no one else had tampered with it.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThat was the \u2018aha\u2019 for me,\u201d Mr. Krishna said. \u201cThis was not really about digital payments, but establishing trust in transactions in general.\u201d He called it \u201ca technology that can change the world.\u201d\nThere are still many in the industry who are skeptical of the long-term significance of the blockchain concept. Doubters have said that it is, at best, a slightly more reliable way to track data, and at worst, a much less efficient method of keeping data than current ones that rely on central gatekeepers.\nAdvertisement\nBut blockchain champions like to compare it to the significance of the internet, which provided a universal computing language for communicating seamlessly among networks. The blockchain, they say, could provide that universal language for valuable data and information.\nA few months after Mr. Krishna\u2019s aha moment, his team presented the idea at an annual gathering where IBM\u2019s top executives consider new technologies that could be major opportunities \u2014 or threats \u2014 to IBM\u2019s business. Blockchain was the first subject of discussion, and the first that Virginia Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive, gave the green light to.\nAdvertisement\nShe turned to Mr. Krishna, the research chief, and said, \u201cYou run with this,\u201d he recalled. She asked for a working version within two months.\nAdvertisement\nHer hurry-up response was a reflection, in part, of IBM\u2019s eagerness to find new businesses to make up for the erosion of its traditional hardware, software and services offerings. The company has made progress with new products like data-analysis software and its Watson artificial intelligence software.\nBut growth in new businesses has not yet offset declines in traditional businesses. In January, IBM reported its 19th consecutive quarterly drop in revenue, though some of that sales retreat was because of profit-draining operations the company sold off, like semiconductor manufacturing and industry-standard server computers.\nAdvertisement\nIBM has already suffered from being late to one of the biggest trends in technology today, cloud computing, where it moved slowly at first and watched the early market leadership go to Amazon and Microsoft.

Like Walmart, Maersk had already been looking for years for a better way to trace the goods it ships around the globe.\nFor Maersk, the problem was not tracking the familiar rectangular shipping containers that sail the world aboard its cargo ships \u2014 instead, it was the mountains of paperwork that go with each container. Maersk had found that a single container could require stamps and approvals from as many as 30 people, including customs, tax officials and health authorities.\nAdvertisement\nWhile the containers themselves can be loaded on a ship in a matter of minutes, a container can be held up in port for days because a piece of paper goes missing, while the goods inside spoil. The cost of moving and keeping track of all this paperwork often equals the cost of physically moving the container around the world.\nWhat\u2019s more, the system is rife with fraud. The valuable bill of lading is often tampered with or copied to let criminals siphon off goods or circulate counterfeit products, leading to billions of dollars in maritime fraud each year.\nMaersk and IBM began working on a version of its software that would be open to everyone involved with every container. When customs authorities signed off on a document, they could immediately upload a copy of it, with a digital signature, so that everyone else involved \u2014 including Maersk and government authorities \u2014 could see that it was complete. If there were disputes later, everyone could go back to the record and be confident that no one had altered it in the meantime. The cryptography involved would make it hard for the virtual signatures to be forged.\nAdvertisement\nThe first test of the system happened last summer and tracked all of the paperwork related to a container of flowers moving from the Port of Mombasa in Kenya to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It went well enough that Maersk and IBM followed up by tracking containers with pineapples from Colombia, and mandarin oranges from California.\nAdvertisement\nThe difficulty of making this work in the real world is that everyone at every step along the way needs to be involved, otherwise it\u2019s unlikely to induce any more confidence than the old system.\n\u201cYou need to have something in it for all stakeholders, in order to get the whole chain going,\u201d said Jakob Stausholm, the chief financial and technology officer at Maersk, who is leading the project. \u201cThat\u2019s the difficult part.\u201d\nIBM and Maersk have recently been seeking cooperation from customs authorities, freight forwarders and the producers that fill the containers. Just last month, Maersk and IBM began running their first trials with these partners involved, on shipping routes between Rotterdam and Newark.\nAdvertisement\nNot everyone has been so willing to buy in to the IBM approach.\nMany technologists who got excited about Bitcoin have said that the newer, corporate-designed blockchains \u2014 like the one being built by IBM \u2014 are missing one of the main elements of Bitcoin\u2019s success, namely the extremely decentralized structure. Anyone in the world can join Bitcoin and, in effect, study its ledgers. But only a limited set of participants can gain access to ones like IBM\u2019s.\nAdvertisement\nThat could make them more vulnerable to attack from, say, a hacker who targets a few of the participants. Even though the IBM technology for tracking shipments is more decentralized than previous methods, \u201cit still concentrates power in a handful of entities,\u201d said Emin Gun Sirer, a professor at Cornell who studies distributed systems.\nThe companies working with IBM have been less worried about these security issues. Almost all of them demanded that the system not be open like Bitcoin. While they are giving up some security benefits, the private blockchains can move faster than Bitcoin, which has been plagued by delays.\nIBM has faced questions from companies worried that the tech giant has too much control over the system it is building and could make them dependent on IBM software for years to come.\nAdvertisement\nIBM tried to fend off this line of attack when it made its software open source in 2015. The foundation that is now in charge of the computer code, the Hyperledger Foundation, has attracted many other companies that are now working on the project alongside IBM. Just in the past week, the Bank of England, Kaiser Permanente and nine other new members joined.\nAdvertisement\nBut the director of the Hyperledger Foundation, Brian Behlendorf, acknowledged that IBM is still the single largest contributor to the project. As a result, it has been an uphill battle to convince others that it is not simply an IBM project.\n\u201cThey have such a head start that it can leave the impression that Hyperledger is an IBM product,\u201d Mr. Behlendorf said. \u201cWe are trying to tell a story about the other companies building on top of Hyperledger. That is emerging. It will take some time.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMicrosoft has fended off this sort of problem by focusing most of its efforts on a blockchain that it had nothing to do with building, the blockchain behind the virtual currency known as Ethereum. This has already helped Microsoft move in on some clients that IBM is also pursuing. Bank of America, for instance, is building a system with Microsoft that will track the flows of money around trade deals.\nBut IBM has taken an early lead. Its list of collaborators includes the likes of the London Stock Exchange and the Bank of Tokyo, and lots of companies outside the financial world like Maersk and Walmart. \u201cThis is the most well-thought-out project in the space,\u201d said Mr. Sirer, the Cornell professor.\nNow all IBM has to do is get the systems out into the real world and show that they work.\n", "name": "Blockchain: A Better Way to Track Pork Chops, Bonds, Bad Peanut Butter?"}, {"text": "The technology is viewed as being harder to corrupt or hack because of its reliance on many people rather than a single authority.\nAdvertisement\nMany big corporations have been looking for ways to use blockchain technology to keep track of information created by unrelated companies, like stock and bond trading transactions.\nIBM has made a particularly big push into the blockchain business, and it has been leading a separate collaborative project, known as the Hyperledger Foundation.\nThe new Ethereum alliance has been described by some of its backers as a way to ensure that the IBM-led blockchain effort is not the only option for businesses looking to use the technology.

Banks could create one blockchain for themselves, and shipping companies could create another for their own purposes.\nAdvertisement\nThe purpose of the alliance is to create a standard, open-source version of Ethereum that can provide a foundation for any specific use case.\nAdvertisement\nThe private systems are not likely to require an Ether virtual currency, although the companies are hoping to create modules that will allow users to put in and take out individual elements of Ethereum as they choose.\nAdvertisement\nMany companies have already been working to create their own versions of Ethereum for specific purposes.\nJPMorgan, for instance, has created a version of Ethereum known as Quorum that the bank has been using in tests to move money between JPMorgan branches in different countries. Quorum will become a part of the new version of Ethereum being developed by the alliance.\nAdvertisement\nSome of the companies working in the new alliance hope that the private Ethereum blockchains will, at some point, be able to connect to the public Ethereum blockchain, creating a standard for information storage and movement around the world.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cEven if you create private networks, if you can anchor them to public networks, you get an extremely strong set of links together,\u201d Mr. Batlin, of BNY Mellon, said.\nThe work on Ethereum has continued despite an attack on an Ethereum project last year in which a hacker gained control of more than $50 million worth of Ether.\nAdvertisement\n", "name": "Business Giants to Announce Creation of a Computing System Based on Ethereum"}, {"text": "With the 111-year-old hotel brimming with eager skiers, hikers and vacationers, some having paid about $530 for a suite with a panoramic view and sauna, Mr. Brandstaetter said he decided to cave in.\nAdvertisement\nGuests had already complained that their electronic room keys were not working, and receptionists\u2019 efforts to create new ones had proved futile.

As a result, however, hackers waged dozens of attacks a day to make them financially viable.\nHe nevertheless counseled victims not to pay, arguing that that would only further encourage more attacks and that the funds used to pay the ransom would bankroll nefarious activity, including possibly terrorism. Hotels, he warned, should also guard against copycat crimes by reinforcing their digital security.\nAdvertisement\nAccording to the United States Justice Department, ransomware attacks quadrupled in 2016 to an average of 4,000 a day.

Credit default swaps, which played a major role in the 2008 financial crisis, are essentially bets on the success of bonds.\nThe D.T.C.C. oversaw about $11 trillion in credit default swaps trading last year, or 80 percent of all trades in the global market. Banks rely on the Trade Information Warehouse to determine when payments are due and what size they will be.\nBecause the database will be edited in group fashion, the hope is that it will provide a more streamlined and reliable source of information.\nAdvertisement\nMr. Bodson said that if the database was successful, the D.T.C.C. could use the technology to move money rather than just record information.\nAdvertisement\nOver the last few years, most banks have announced efforts to explore the potential utility of blockchain technology.

In 2015, a Miami federal district judge issued a summons to Bank of America and Citibank for almost nine years of records from correspondent accounts they maintained on behalf of a bank in Belize that was used to shield assets.\nAdvertisement\nUnfortunately, there is little Coinbase can do to resist this type of demand for information once it is approved by the court. It could refuse to provide the information and then appeal an order requiring it to comply with the summons, but the anonymity cherished by many Bitcoin users is unlikely to get much traction when there is evidence of potential tax evasion. Failing to provide the information could also result in Coinbase being found in contempt of court, which can result in substantial fines until it chooses to comply.\nThe I.R.S. inquiry shows how Coinbase is now important enough to draw the same kind of scrutiny as more established banks.

Mr. Prentice held a variety of cabinet posts in the Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper from 2006 to 2010. He stood out in what was an otherwise highly partisan government by acknowledging the concerns of people and groups who were opposed to its positions.\nAdvertisement\nCoinage. Central banks are not about to abandon their currencies and turn everything over to Bitcoin. But they are exploring the technology that underlies the digital currency. Nathaniel Popper, a colleague of mine who literally wrote the book on Bitcoin, reported that the Bank of Canada teamed up with Canada\u2019s five largest banks and a consulting firm to run a major digital currency simulation over the summer.\nAdvertisement\nReturn to sender. Disputes in the world of philosophy, it seems, can get down and quite dirty. Carrie Ichikawa Jenkins of the University of British Columbia, whose studies have ranged from the knowledge of arithmetic to the nature of romantic love, is one of four philosophers who recently received feces in the mail. The identity of the sender is still unknown. But all four recipients, Jennifer Schuessler found, have been \u201cloosely connected through a long-running, multisided argument with one of the field\u2019s most vocal figures.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nPortrait. The current exhibition of German and Austrian art at the Neue Gallery in New York focuses on women in the work of Gustav Klimt. In his review for The New York Times, Ken Johnson mentioned an interesting Canadian connection to the artist. M\u00e4da Primavesi was just 9 years old when she posed for one of Klimt\u2019s most famous paintings. After World War II, she moved to Canada, where she founded and ran a convalescent home for children in Montreal. Well before her death in 2000, Ms. Primavesi made news by selling a portrait painted by Klimt of her mother, which had widely been thought lost.\nSuccession. This week, one contender for the leadership of the Conservative Party, Tony Clement, quit the race; another, Erin O\u2019Toole, officially joined it, and a third, Lisa Raitt, edged toward candidacy.

The goal would be to make the financial system more transparent, fast, efficient and secure.\nIf the central banks succeed, it would be one of the greatest unexpected twists in new technology: An invention aimed at dethroning central banks and making it harder for money to be tracked instead ends up empowering those central banks and making money more easily traceable.\nThe Bank of England has produced several research papers on the topic. One suggests that the economic benefits of issuing a digital currency on a distributed ledger could add as much as 3 percent to a country\u2019s economic output, thanks to the efficiency it could offer.\nAdvertisement\nA deputy governor at the People\u2019s Bank of China, Fan Yifei, wrote for Bloomberg View that \u201cthe conditions are ripe for digital currencies, which can reduce operating costs, increase efficiency and enable a wide range of new applications.\u201d\nEvery weekday, twice a day, get the news driving the markets and the latest on mergers and acquisitions.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Yellen, was asked about the technology at a congressional hearing. She said that \u201cinnovation using these technologies could be extremely helpful and bring benefits to society.\u201d\nThe Fed has been pushed to act by the big banks that it regulates, many of which are experimenting with distributed ledgers as a way to settle trades and record data and transactions. Just last week, JPMorgan Chase said it was moving toward a public release this year of its \u201centerprise grade\u201d blockchain.\nMost financial institutions and central banks are looking at distributed ledgers that would be maintained on the computers of all the major players in the financial system, including the central bank and the biggest financial institutions.\nAdvertisement\nIn the systems being discussed, each player in the system would communicate with all the others anytime money moved in the system, allowing everyone to update the ledgers on their computer systems simultaneously. This would provide multiple backups if the central bank\u2019s computers came under attack. It would also hypothetically allow them to complete transactions much more quickly, and would make it easier to spot rogue actors.\nAdvertisement\nEric Piscini, who oversees work on blockchain by the consulting firm Deloitte, said that a year ago, central banks were looking at the technology mostly because they wanted to understand what private banks were talking about.\nAdvertisement\nNow, he says, the central banks are embracing the technology to revamp their own infrastructures.\nAt the headquarters of the Netherlands\u2019 central bank in Amsterdam, Ron Berndsen set up five laptops to run an experimental virtual currency, derived from the Bitcoin software. The coins issued in the system were nicknamed Dukatons, after a 17th-century silver coin used in the time when the Netherlands was a part of the Spanish Empire.\nMr. Berndsen operated the Dukaton system for three months to see what would happen if the central bank were setting the rules and did not have the same limits as Bitcoin. While the experiment was a success, he is now thinking much bigger and is in constant conversation with other central bank officials who are looking at ways to put their own currencies on distributed ledgers.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThere are so many things going on that it is hard to keep track of all the contacts,\u201d said Mr. Berndsen, the head of market infrastructure at the Dutch central bank. \u201cI hear from other central bank colleagues that it is the same everywhere.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe experimentation so far has taken on many different forms and contemplated many different roles for distributed ledgers to play in the financial system.\nThe Russian national bank said last week that it had worked with a consortium of Russia\u2019s biggest banks to develop its own distributed ledger, which it called Masterchain. The Russian institutions have been sending messages on the system but are also looking at it as a potential \u201ccomponent of the new-generation financial infrastructure in the future.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe Bank of Canada teamed up with the nation\u2019s five largest banks \u2014 and the blockchain consulting firm R3 \u2014 for what was known as Project Jasper. In a simulation run this summer, the central bank issued so-called CAD-Coins onto a blockchain similar to the one that underlies the Bitcoin alternative known as Ethereum.\nThe banks used the CAD-Coins to exchange money \u2014 in this case fictional money \u2014 the way they do at the end of each day to settle their master accounts.\nCarolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said in an interview that while the experiment was a success, a great deal of testing is still necessary before the bank can decide whether distributed ledger technology is ready for the real world.\nAdvertisement\nCritics of blockchain technology have noted the apparent contradiction in central banks\u2019 looking to distributed ledgers.\nAdvertisement\nThe blockchain was created to allow Bitcoin transactions to be recorded communally so that a central authority, such as a central bank, would not be necessary. If a central bank is involved and keeping track, why go to the trouble of keeping records communally?\nThe distributed ledgers being discussed by central bankers also generally lack the openness that has been one of the most attractive attributes of the Bitcoin network.\nAdvertisement\nWith Bitcoin, anyone can join the network and help support it, which has helped it win a following. The distributed ledgers being considered by the financial industry and central banks would generally allow only a small number of registered entities to join in and take part in the network.\nMark Carney, the head of the Bank of England, and perhaps the most prominent champion of distributed ledgers, has said that the technology could be worth using for central banks because it would make for a financial system that does not go down even if the central bank\u2019s computer systems are temporarily taken offline.\nAdvertisement\nThe Bank of England said last month that it wanted the next version of the bank\u2019s basic software infrastructure to be compatible with distributed ledgers.\n", "name": "Central Banks Consider Bitcoin\u2019s Technology, if Not Bitcoin"}, {"text": "This challenge is coming to light with new data privacy rules like the European Union\u2019s general data protection regulation, which will add new consumer data privacy and ownership rights over the next two years.

Little wonder that Accenture clients are asking how they will defend the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d rules using blockchain technology that always remembers.\nBlockchain\u2019s immutability could eventually run at odds with existing regulations, too. For example, the United States Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Regulation S-P all require personal financial data to be easily redacted.\nFor blockchain purists, simply questioning the immutable nature of the technology is a heresy to be resisted. Like the early internet pioneers who saw e-commerce as a crass concept that would spell the end of the web as a place for \u201ccooperation and helpfulness,\u201d many of today\u2019s strongest blockchain advocates, though often highly inventive and visionary, tend to be more idealistic than pragmatic about blockchain\u2019s evolution.

Even after the project\u2019s leaders succeeded in winning a consensus of participants to bifurcate the code at a point before the transaction occurred, a large number of participants continue to use the version of the chain where the theft occurred.\nAdvertisement\nOne thing is clear: If the financial services industry is to embrace a new technology, it cannot be one in which mischief and mistakes are immutable and fraudsters can defend their actions on spurious ideological grounds.
